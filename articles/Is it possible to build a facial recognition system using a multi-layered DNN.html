                <title>Is it possible to build a facial recognition system using a multi-layered DNN?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Yes, it is possible to build a facial recognition system using a multi-layered deep neural network (DNN). A DNN is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is composed of multiple layers of neurons. Each layer of neurons is connected to the next layer, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and recognize features in an image. By using a multi-layered DNN, it is possible to create a facial recognition system that can accurately identify a person's face from a digital image. The system can be trained to recognize different facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and can be used to identify a person from a database of images. Additionally, the system can be used to detect facial expressions and emotions, making it a powerful tool for security and surveillance applications.">

This dataset should include images of different people, taken from different angles and in different lighting conditions. Once the dataset is collected, it can be used to train the DNN.</p><br><p class="article-text">The training process involves feeding the DNN with the images from the dataset and teaching it to recognize patterns in the images. This is done by adjusting the weights of the neurons in each layer of the network. As the DNN is trained, it will become better at recognizing patterns in the images and making predictions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6963098/pexels-photo-6963098.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-people-night-dark"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the DNN is trained, it can be used to recognize faces in new images. This is done by feeding the new images into the DNN and having it make predictions based on the patterns it has learned. The accuracy of the predictions will depend on the quality of the training dataset and the complexity of the DNN.</p><br>
