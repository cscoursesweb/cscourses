<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When it comes to wireless earbuds, Apple’s AirPods are some of the most popular on the market. They offer great sound quality, a comfortable fit, and easy connectivity with Apple devices. But one of the most important questions people have about AirPods is whether or not they are waterproof. In this article, we’ll answer that question and provide some tips for keeping your AirPods safe from water damage.</p>

<h3>What Does Apple Say About Water Resistance?</h3>
<p>Apple states that AirPods (2nd generation) and AirPods Pro are “splash and water resistant” but not waterproof. This means that they can handle a few splashes of water but should not be submerged in water or exposed to heavy rain or other liquids. If your AirPods do get wet, you should dry them off immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth.</p>			
<h3>How Can You Protect Your AirPods From Water Damage?</h3>
<p>The best way to protect your AirPods from water damage is to keep them in their charging case when not in use. The charging case is designed to be splash-resistant and will help keep your AirPods safe from accidental spills or splashes of water. Additionally, you should avoid using your AirPods while swimming or showering as this could cause permanent damage to the internal components of the earbuds.</p>

<h3>What Should You Do If Your AirPods Get Wet?</h3>
<p>If your AirPods do get wet, you should dry them off immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth and then place them back in their charging case for at least 3 hours before using them again. This will give the internal components time to dry out completely before being used again. Additionally, if you notice any signs of corrosion on the metal parts of your earbuds or charging case, you should stop using them immediately and contact Apple Support for further assistance.</p>
