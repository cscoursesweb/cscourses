<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>OpenAI Codex is an upcoming open source platform for artificial intelligence (AI) research. It is being developed by OpenAI, a non-profit research organization founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. The platform is designed to make AI research more accessible and easier to use for developers, researchers, and students. It will provide a comprehensive set of tools for building, training, and deploying AI models.</p>
<p>OpenAI has been working on the project since 2018 and has made significant progress in developing the platform. However, there is still no official release date for OpenAI Codex yet. In this blog post, we will discuss when OpenAI Codex might be released and what features it might include.</p>

<h3>What Is OpenAI Codex?</h3>
<p>OpenAI Codex is an open source platform that provides a comprehensive set of tools for building, training, and deploying AI models. It is designed to make AI research more accessible and easier to use for developers, researchers, and students. The platform will include a library of pre-trained models that can be used as starting points for new projects or as reference implementations of existing algorithms. It will also provide an API that allows developers to easily integrate their own models into the platform.</p>
<p>The goal of OpenAI Codex is to make AI research more accessible by providing a unified platform with all the necessary tools in one place. This will allow developers to quickly get started with their projects without having to learn multiple different frameworks or languages. Additionally, it will enable researchers to collaborate more easily on projects by sharing code and data sets across different platforms.</p>

<h3>When Will OpenAI Codex Be Released?</h3>
<p>At this point in time, there is still no official release date for OpenAI Codex yet. However, it is expected that the platform will be released sometime in 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. This timeline could change depending on how quickly development progresses over the next few months or years.</p>
<p>OpenAI has been working on the project since 2018 but has not provided any updates on its progress since then. This could mean that development has stalled or that they are simply keeping quiet about their progress until they are ready to launch the platform publicly. Either way, it seems likely that we won't see an official release until at least 2021 or 2022 at the earliest.</p>			
<h3>What Features Will OpenAI Codex Include?</h3>
<p>At this point in time it's unclear exactly what features OpenAI Codex will include when it's released but we can make some educated guesses based on what we know so far about the project:</p>
<p>- A library of pre-trained models: This library would provide developers with access to a range of pre-trained models which they can use as starting points for their own projects or as reference implementations of existing algorithms;</p>
<p>- An API: This would allow developers to easily integrate their own models into the platform;</p>
<p>- Collaboration tools: These would enable researchers to share code and data sets across different platforms;</p>
<p>- Documentation: This would provide detailed instructions on how to use each feature of the platform;</p>
<p>- Tutorials: These would help users get up-to-speed quickly with using the platform;</p>
<p>- Support: This would ensure users have access to help if they run into any issues while using the platform;</p>
<p>- Security measures: These would ensure user data remains secure while using the platform;</p>
<p>- Machine learning capabilities: These would enable users to build powerful machine learning applications using OpenAI's technology stack;</p>
<p>- Cloud integration: This would allow users to deploy their applications directly from within the platform onto cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>OpenAI Codex is an exciting new open source project that promises to make AI research more accessible and easier to use for developers, researchers, and students alike. While there is still no official release date yet for when it might be released publicly, it seems likely that we won't see an official launch until at least 2021 or 2022 at earliest given how long development has been ongoing so far without any updates from OpenAI themselves yet about its progress.. When it does eventually launch though we can expect it include a library of pre-trained models along with an API allowing developers easy integration into their own projects as well as collaboration tools enabling researchers share code across different platforms plus documentation tutorials support security measures machine learning capabilities cloud integration and much more!</p>
