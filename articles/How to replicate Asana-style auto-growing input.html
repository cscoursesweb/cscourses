                        <p class="article-text">Asana is a popular project management tool that allows users to easily create tasks and assign them to team members. One of the most useful features of Asana is its auto-growing input, which allows users to quickly add additional information to a task without having to manually resize the input field. This feature is especially useful for tasks that require a lot of detail, such as bug reports or feature requests.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">If you’re looking to replicate Asana-style auto-growing input in your own web application, there are a few steps you’ll need to take. First, you’ll need to create an HTML textarea element with the appropriate attributes. This element should have a “rows” attribute set to “1”, and a “cols” attribute set to “50”. This will ensure that the textarea is initially small enough to fit on the page.</p><br><p class="article-text">Next, you’ll need to add some JavaScript code to your page. This code should detect when the user has entered more text than can fit in the textarea, and then resize the textarea accordingly. To do this, you’ll need to use the “scrollHeight” property of the textarea element. This property will tell you how much space the text inside the textarea is taking up. If the scrollHeight is greater than the height of the textarea, then you know that the textarea needs to be resized.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you’ll need to add some CSS to your page. This CSS should set the “overflow” property of the textarea to “hidden”. This will ensure that the textarea will not scroll when it is resized.</p><br>
