Programming languages are used to create instructions for computers to execute. They are used to write code that can be compiled into an executable program. Examples of programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. 

Coding languages are a subset of programming languages that are">

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When it comes to computer programming, there is often confusion between the terms “programming language” and “coding language”. While these two terms are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to two different concepts. Understanding the difference between them is essential for anyone who wants to learn how to program computers.</p>
<p>A programming language is a set of instructions that can be used to create a program or application. It is a formal language that consists of commands, keywords, symbols, and other elements that are used to write code. Programming languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and understand, but they must also be able to be understood by computers in order for them to execute the instructions correctly. Examples of popular programming languages include Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Coding languages are a type of programming language that is specifically designed for writing code. They are usually more concise than general-purpose programming languages and have fewer features. Coding languages are typically used for specific tasks such as web development or game development. Examples of popular coding languages include HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Using Programming Languages</h3>
<p>Programming languages offer many benefits over coding languages when it comes to creating programs or applications. One of the main advantages is that they allow developers to create complex programs with fewer lines of code than would be required with coding languages. This makes it easier for developers to debug their programs and make changes quickly without having to rewrite large sections of code from scratch. Additionally, programming languages provide more flexibility when it comes to creating applications since they can be used across multiple platforms without needing any modifications or special libraries installed on each platform separately.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using programming languages is that they allow developers to create more efficient programs since they can take advantage of features such as object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP allows developers to create reusable components which can then be reused in other parts of their program without having to rewrite the same code multiple times over again. This makes it easier for developers to maintain their programs over time since they don’t have as much redundant code cluttering up their projects.</p>
<p>Finally, programming languages also provide better security than coding languages since they have built-in security features such as type safety which prevents malicious code from being executed on a user’s computer system without their knowledge or consent. This makes it much harder for hackers or malicious actors from taking advantage of vulnerabilities in an application written in a programming language compared with one written in a coding language which may not have any built-in security measures at all.</p>

<h3>The Benefits Of Using Coding Languages</h3>
<p>While coding languages may not offer all the same features as general-purpose programming languages do, they still offer some distinct advantages over them when it comes time for creating applications or websites quickly and efficiently. One major benefit is that coding languages are usually much simpler than general-purpose programming languages so developers don’t need as much experience or knowledge in order to use them effectively compared with using a full-fledged programming language like Java or C++ which require more expertise in order for someone newbie programmer get up and running quickly with them .</p>
<p>Additionally, coding languages tend to be faster than general-purpose ones since they don’t require as many lines of code in order for someone newbie programmer get up and running quickly with them . This means that developers can create applications faster since there isn’t as much overhead involved when writing code compared with using a full-fledged programming language like Java or C++ which require more expertise in order for someone newbie programmer get up and running quickly with them .</p>
<p>Finally, coding languages also tend to be more secure than general-purpose ones since most modern web browsers now support HTML5 which provides built-in security measures such as cross site scripting protection (XSS) which helps protect users from malicious actors trying take advantage vulnerabilities within an application written using HTML5 . This means that even if someone does manage find an exploit within an application written using HTML5 , chances are good that XSS protection will prevent any malicious code from being executed on user's computer system without their knowledge or consent .</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion , while both types of computer language -programming & coding -have their own unique advantages & disadvantages , understanding the difference between them & knowing when & how use each one effectively will help ensure success when developing software applications & websites . By understanding what each type offers , developers will be able choose best option depending on project requirements & ensure maximum efficiency & security throughout entire development process .</p>
