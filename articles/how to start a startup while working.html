<h3> Make a Plan</h3>
<p>The first step in starting a business while working is to make a plan. This plan should include your goals and objectives, as well as the steps you need to take in order to achieve them.

<h3> Create Your Business Model</h3>
<p>Once you have found funding sources for your startup, it’s time to create a business model that outlines how the company will operate and generate revenue. This model should include information about pricing strategies, marketing plans, customer service policies, product development plans, etc. Creating this model will help ensure that all aspects of the company are taken into consideration when launching the startup and will help ensure its success in the long run.</p>

<h3> Get Started</h3>
<p>Now that you have done all of the necessary planning and preparation work for starting a business while working full-time, it’s time to get started! Start by setting up shop (if necessary) and getting all of the necessary paperwork in order (business licenses/permits). Then begin marketing your product or service through various channels such as social media or traditional advertising methods like print ads or radio spots. Finally launch your product or service with an official launch event or press release so that people know about it!</p>
<p>By following these steps carefully and diligently while still working full-time can help ensure success when launching a startup while still employed elsewhere! Good luck!</p>
