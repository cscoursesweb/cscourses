                    <h1 class="title">Does TOR Leak Time and Time Zone?</h1>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether or not TOR leaks time and time zone is no. TOR, or The Onion Router, is a free, open-source software that is designed to protect users’ privacy and anonymity online. It does this by routing internet traffic through a network of relays, which are run by volunteers around the world. This means that the user’s IP address is hidden, and their location is not revealed.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">However, it is important to note that while TOR does not leak time and time zone information, it is possible for websites to track a user’s time and time zone. This is because websites can use JavaScript to detect the user’s time zone and then use this information to track the user’s activities. This means that even if a user is using TOR, they may still be vulnerable to tracking.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/48770/business-time-clock-clocks-48770.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="london-new-york-tokyo-and-moscow-clocks"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In order to protect against this type of tracking, it is important to disable JavaScript in the browser. This can be done by using a browser extension such as NoScript or uMatrix. Additionally, it is important to use a VPN when using TOR, as this will further protect the user’s privacy and anonymity.</p><br>
