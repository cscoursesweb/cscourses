                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether you can use a GPL component in your site without having to disclose the sources of your site is no. The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used free software license that requires anyone who distributes a program to make the source code available to the public. This means that if you use a GPL component in your site, you must make the source code of your site available to the public.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The GPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open source. It does this by requiring anyone who distributes a program to make the source code available to the public. This ensures that the software remains free and open source, and that anyone can modify and improve it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6572421/pexels-photo-6572421.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="textured-background-of-solar-panels-in-countryside-field"><figcaption>picture by Kelly</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, the GPL does not require you to make the source code of your site available to the public. It only requires you to make the source code of the GPL component available. This means that you can use a GPL component in your site without having to disclose the sources of your site.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, there are some important caveats to this. First, you must still comply with the terms of the GPL. This means that you must make the source code of the GPL component available to the public. Second, you must also comply with any other licenses that may apply to the GPL component. For example, if the GPL component is licensed under a different license, such as the Apache License, then you must comply with the terms of that license as well.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4489748/pexels-photo-4489748.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-black-and-red-pullover-hoodie-standing-near-red-and-black-wall"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to note that the GPL does not give you the right to use a GPL component in your site without giving credit to the original author. You must still give credit to the original author of the GPL component, and you must also make sure that any modifications you make to the component are also made available to the public.</p><br>
