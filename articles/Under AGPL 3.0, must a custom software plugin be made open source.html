                        <p class="article-text">The answer to the question of whether a custom software plugin must be made open source under the AGPL 3.0 license is yes. The AGPL 3.0 license is a type of open source license that requires any modifications or additions to the software to be made available to the public under the same license. This means that any custom software plugin created for a program that is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 must also be made open source.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The AGPL 3.0 license is a type of “copyleft” license, which means that any modifications or additions to the software must be made available to the public under the same license. This is in contrast to a “permissive” license, which allows modifications and additions to be made without requiring them to be made open source.</p><br><p class="article-text">The AGPL 3.0 license is designed to ensure that any modifications or additions to the software are made available to the public. This is to ensure that the software remains open source and that any improvements or changes made to the software are available to everyone.</p><br>
