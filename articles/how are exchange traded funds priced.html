<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a type of investment fund that is traded on a stock exchange. They are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a basket of securities, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks. This makes them attractive to investors who want to take advantage of short-term market movements or who want to diversify their portfolios without having to buy individual stocks or bonds. But how exactly are ETFs priced?</p>
<p>In order to understand how ETFs are priced, it is important to first understand the concept of net asset value (NAV). NAV is the total value of all the assets held by an ETF divided by the number of shares outstanding. This means that if an ETF holds $100 million worth of assets and has 10 million shares outstanding, then its NAV would be $10 per share.</p>			
<h3>How Does NAV Affect ETF Prices?</h3>
<p>The price of an ETF is determined by supply and demand in the market. If there is more demand for an ETF than there is supply, then its price will rise above its NAV. Conversely, if there is more supply than demand for an ETF then its price will fall below its NAV. This means that investors can buy or sell an ETF at a premium or discount depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some ETFs may trade at a premium or discount even when there is no difference between supply and demand in the market. This can happen when certain factors such as liquidity or tracking error come into play. Liquidity refers to how easily an investor can buy or sell shares in an ETF without significantly affecting its price. Tracking error occurs when the performance of an ETF does not match up with the performance of its underlying assets due to fees and other costs associated with running the fund.</p>

<h3>Factors That Impact The Price Of An ETF</h3>
<p>There are several factors that can impact the price of an ETF including: * Market conditions: As mentioned above, supply and demand in the market will affect the price of an ETF relative to its NAV. If there is more demand than supply then prices will rise above NAV while if there is more supply than demand then prices will fall below NAV. * Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easily investors can buy or sell shares in an ETF without significantly affecting its price. If liquidity is low then it may be difficult for investors to buy or sell shares without significantly impacting prices which could lead to premiums or discounts relative to NAV even when there isn’t a difference between supply and demand in the market. * Tracking error: Tracking error occurs when the performance of an ETF does not match up with the performance of its underlying assets due to fees and other costs associated with running the fund which could lead to premiums or discounts relative to NAV even when there isn’t a difference between supply and demand in the market.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Understanding how exchange traded funds (ETFs) are priced can help investors make informed decisions about their investments. The price of an ETF is determined by supply and demand in the market but other factors such as liquidity and tracking error can also have an impact on prices relative to their net asset value (NAV).
