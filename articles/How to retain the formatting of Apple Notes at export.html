                        <p class="article-text">If you’re an Apple user, you’ve probably used the Notes app to jot down ideas, take notes, and store important information. But what happens when you want to export your notes and retain the formatting? Fortunately, there are a few ways to do this. In this article, we’ll discuss how to retain the formatting of Apple Notes at export.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to make sure you’re using the latest version of the Notes app. Apple regularly updates the app with new features and bug fixes, so it’s important to stay up to date. To check for updates, open the App Store and tap the Updates tab. If there’s an update available for Notes, tap the Update button.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/147413/twitter-facebook-together-exchange-of-information-147413.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="facebook-application-icon"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you’ve updated the app, you’ll need to export your notes. To do this, open the Notes app and select the note you want to export. Tap the Share icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and select the format you want to export the note in. You can choose from PDF, RTF, or plain text.</p><br><p class="article-text">When you export the note, the formatting will be retained. However, if you’re exporting to a plain text file, the formatting won’t be retained. To retain the formatting, you’ll need to export the note as a PDF or RTF file.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/379964/pexels-photo-379964.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-jumping-on-intermodal-container"><figcaption>picture by Kaique Rocha</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you’re exporting to a PDF or RTF file, you can also choose to include images and attachments. To do this, tap the Include Images and Attachments option before you export the note. This will ensure that any images or attachments you’ve added to the note are included in the exported file.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re exporting to a PDF or RTF file, you can also choose to password-protect the file. To do this, tap the Password Protect option before you export the note. This will ensure that only those with the password can open the exported file.</p><br>
