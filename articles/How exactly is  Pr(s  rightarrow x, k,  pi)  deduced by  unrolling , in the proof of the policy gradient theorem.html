                <title>How exactly is $Pr(s \rightarrow x, k, \pi)$ deduced by "unrolling", in the proof of the policy gradient theorem?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article will explain how the probability $Pr(s \rightarrow x, k, \pi)$ is deduced by "unrolling" in the proof of the policy gradient theorem. We will first discuss the concept of unrolling and how it is used in the proof of the policy gradient theorem. We will then explain the steps involved in unrolling the probability $Pr(s \rightarrow x, k, \pi)$ and how it is used to deduce the policy gradient theorem. Finally, we will provide an example of how this process works in practice. By the end of this article, readers should have a better understanding of how the probability $Pr(s \rightarrow x, k, \pi)$ is deduced by unrolling in the proof of the policy gradient theorem.">

                        <p class="article-text">The policy gradient theorem is a powerful tool for reinforcement learning, which states that the expected return of a policy is equal to the expected value of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. This theorem is used to derive the optimal policy for a given environment, and is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning algorithms.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">In order to prove the policy gradient theorem, we must first understand the concept of unrolling. Unrolling is a technique used to deduce the probability of a state transition from a given state to a new state, given a policy and a set of parameters. This is done by recursively applying the policy to the current state, and then calculating the probability of transitioning to the new state.</p><br><p class="article-text">To illustrate this concept, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with two states, s and x, and a policy π. We want to calculate the probability of transitioning from s to x, given the policy and parameters.</p><br><p class="article-text">To do this, we first need to calculate the probability of transitioning from s to x, given the policy and parameters. This is done by unrolling the policy. We start by calculating the probability of transitioning from s to x, given the policy and parameters. This is done by recursively applying the policy to the current state, and then calculating the probability of transitioning to the new state.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1297628/pexels-photo-1297628.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="grayscale-photo-of-transit-train"><figcaption>picture by Paweł L.</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">For example, if the policy is to move from s to x with probability 0.5, then the probability of transitioning from s to x is 0.5. We then calculate the probability of transitioning from x to s, given the policy and parameters. This is done by recursively applying the policy to the current state, and then calculating the probability of transitioning to the new state.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In this way, we can unroll the policy to calculate the probability of transitioning from s to x, given the policy and parameters. This is the probability that is used in the proof of the policy gradient theorem.</p><br>
