<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Amazon is one of the most successful companies in the world today, and it has come a long way since its humble beginnings. But where did it all start? In this blog post, we'll take a look at the history of Amazon and how it grew from a small online bookstore to one of the largest companies in the world.</p>
<p>The Early Years: 1994-1997</p>
<p>Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, who had previously worked on Wall Street as a financial analyst. He had an idea for an online bookstore that would offer customers more selection than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. He quit his job and moved to Seattle to pursue his dream.</p>
<p>In July 1995, Amazon opened its virtual doors for business with only five employees and a few thousand books for sale. Bezos was determined to make Amazon the “Earth’s biggest bookstore” and he quickly began expanding the selection by adding music, videos, software, toys, electronics, and more.</p>
<p>By 1997, Amazon had grown to over 1 million customers and was generating $15 million in annual sales. It was also listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol AMZN. This marked a major milestone for Amazon as it began its journey towards becoming one of the most successful companies in history.</p>
<p>The Expansion Years: 1998-2002</p>
<p>In 1998, Amazon launched its first international website in Germany and soon after expanded into France, Japan, Canada, China, Italy, Spain, and other countries around the world. This marked an important step forward for Amazon as it began to establish itself as a global brand.</p>
<p>In 1999, Amazon acquired several companies including IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) and Alexa Internet (a web traffic analysis company). These acquisitions helped expand Amazon’s reach even further by providing additional services such as movie reviews and web analytics tools.</p>
<p>By 2002, Amazon had grown to over 10 million customers worldwide with annual sales of over $3 billion dollars. It had also become one of the most recognizable brands on the internet with its iconic logo featuring an arrow pointing from A to Z (representing its vast selection).</p>
<p>The Growth Years: 2003-Present</p>
<p>In 2003, Amazon launched its own web services platform which allowed developers to build applications on top of its infrastructure. This marked another major milestone for Amazon as it began to move away from just being an online retailer towards becoming a technology company that provided services such as cloud computing and data storage solutions.</p>
<p>In 2006, Amazon acquired Zappos (an online shoe retailer) which helped expand its product selection even further into apparel and accessories categories. The following year saw another major acquisition when Amazon purchased Audible (an audiobook company) which allowed them to offer digital audio books through their Kindle e-reader devices.</p>
<p>Over the years since then, Amazon has continued to grow at an incredible rate with annual sales now exceeding $280 billion dollars worldwide! They have also expanded their product selection even further by launching their own grocery delivery service (Amazon Fresh), streaming video service (Prime Video), music streaming service (Prime Music), cloud gaming platform (Twitch Prime), home automation products (Echo/Alexa), fashion lines (Amazon Fashion), healthcare products (Amazon Care), logistics services (Amazon Logistics), artificial intelligence products (AWS AI Services) ,and much more!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>From humble beginnings as an online bookstore in 1994 to one of the largest companies in history today - this is how Amazon started! Jeff Bezos’ vision for creating “Earth’s biggest bookstore” has been realized many times over with their expansive product selection that now includes almost anything you can think of! With no signs of slowing down anytime soon - we can only imagine what new innovations they will come up with next!</p>
