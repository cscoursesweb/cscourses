                        <p class="article-text">If you’re an Apple user, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of your Mac OS X disconnecting from your Wi-Fi network when left idle. This can be incredibly annoying, especially if you’re in the middle of an important task and suddenly find yourself without an internet connection. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to prevent your Mac OS X from resetting or disconnecting from Wi-Fi when left idle.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to make sure your Wi-Fi network is set up correctly. If your Wi-Fi network is not configured properly, it can cause your Mac OS X to disconnect from the network when left idle. To check your network settings, open the System Preferences window and select the Network icon. Make sure your Wi-Fi network is selected and that the settings are correct.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7015034/pexels-photo-7015034.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-faceless-woman-working-on-laptop-and-graphic-tablet"><figcaption>picture by George Milton</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to make sure your Mac OS X is up to date. Apple regularly releases updates to its operating system, and these updates often include bug fixes and other improvements that can help prevent your Mac OS X from disconnecting from Wi-Fi when left idle. To check for updates, open the App Store and click on the Updates tab. If there are any available updates, install them.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third step is to make sure your Wi-Fi router is up to date. Like Apple, router manufacturers also regularly release updates to their products. These updates can help improve the performance of your Wi-Fi network and can help prevent your Mac OS X from disconnecting from Wi-Fi when left idle. To check for updates, log into your router’s web interface and look for a firmware update option.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6489044/pexels-photo-6489044.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gaming-gear-in-a-dark-room"><figcaption>picture by Maurício Mascaro</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The fourth step is to make sure your Mac OS X is not set to automatically disconnect from Wi-Fi when left idle. To check this setting, open the System Preferences window and select the Network icon. Select your Wi-Fi network and click the Advanced button. In the Advanced window, make sure the “Disconnect from Wi-Fi when computer is idle” option is not checked.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re still having problems with your Mac OS X disconnecting from Wi-Fi when left idle, you may want to try resetting your network settings. To do this, open the System Preferences window and select the Network icon. Click the Advanced button and then click the Reset button. This will reset all of your network settings, including your Wi-Fi settings, and may help resolve the issue.</p><br>
