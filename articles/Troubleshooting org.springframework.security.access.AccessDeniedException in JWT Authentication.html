        <p class="article-text">If you are getting an org.springframework.security.access.AccessDeniedException: Access Denied even after data is saved to the database in jwtAtuentication, it is likely due to an issue with your authentication configuration. This exception is thrown when a user attempts to access a resource that they do not have permission to access.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181271/pexels-photo-1181271.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-and-gray-laptop-computer-turned-on-doing-computer-codes"><figcaption>picture by Christina Morillo</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first step in troubleshooting this issue is to ensure that the user is properly authenticated. This can be done by checking the authentication configuration in your application. If the authentication configuration is correct, then the next step is to check the authorization configuration. Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a resource.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the authorization configuration is correct, then the next step is to check the database. It is possible that the data is not being saved correctly or that the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the data.

                        <p class="article-text">Once the issue has been identified, it is important to fix the issue as soon as possible.
