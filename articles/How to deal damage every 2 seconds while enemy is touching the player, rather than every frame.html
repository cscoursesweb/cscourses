                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to dealing damage to an enemy in a video game, it is important to consider how often the damage should be dealt. If the damage is dealt too often, it can become tedious and repetitive for the player. On the other hand, if the damage is dealt too infrequently, it can be difficult for the player to make progress. One way to address this issue is to deal damage every two seconds while the enemy is touching the player, rather than every frame.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in dealing damage every two seconds is to create a timer. This timer should be set to two seconds and should be triggered when the enemy touches the player. When the timer is triggered, the game should check to see if the enemy is still touching the player. If the enemy is still touching the player, then the game should deal damage to the enemy. If the enemy is no longer touching the player, then the timer should be reset and the process should start again.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1001487/pexels-photo-1001487.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="brown-vehicle-beside-tree-trunks"><figcaption>picture by Olivia Nuño</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to determine how much damage should be dealt. This will depend on the game and the type of enemy. Generally, it is best to deal a moderate amount of damage, as this will give the player a chance to make progress without becoming too frustrated. It is also important to consider the enemy’s health and armor, as this will affect how much damage is dealt.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to consider how the player will be notified when damage is dealt. This can be done through visual and audio cues, such as a flash of light or a sound effect. This will help the player to understand that damage has been dealt and will also make the game more engaging.</p><br>
