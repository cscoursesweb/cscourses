<h3> Why Is Women's Entrepreneurship Day Important?</h3>
<p>Women’s Entrepreneurship Day (WED) serves as an important reminder that women can be successful business owners too! Despite facing many challenges such as lack of access to capital or networks that can help them succeed in business ownership; women have made great strides over the years in becoming successful business owners. WED serves as a platform for these women to come together and celebrate each other’s successes while also providing resources for those just starting out on their entrepreneurial journey.</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating existing female business owners; WED also serves as an important reminder that there are still many barriers preventing more women from becoming successful business owners such as lack of access to capital or networks that can help them succeed in business ownership; gender bias; or lack of support from family or friends due to cultural norms or expectations about what roles men/women should play within society. By recognizing these issues on WED we can work towards creating more equitable opportunities for all aspiring female entrepreneurs regardless of race/ethnicity/class/etc..</p>
