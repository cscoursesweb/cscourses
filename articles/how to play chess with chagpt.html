                            <p>ChatGPT is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind that uses AI to play chess against humans. It was designed to be an AI-based opponent for players of all levels, from beginners to grandmasters. The program was trained using millions of games from professional players and can adapt its strategy based on its opponent's moves.</p>			
                            <h3>How Does ChatGPT Work?</h3>
                            <p>ChatGPT works by analyzing the board position and making moves based on its analysis. It looks at all possible moves and evaluates them based on their probability of success. The program then chooses the move that it believes will give it the best chance of winning the game.</p>
