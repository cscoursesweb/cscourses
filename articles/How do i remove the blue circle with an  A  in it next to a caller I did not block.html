                        <p class="article-text">If you have noticed a blue circle with an “A” in it next to a caller you did not block, you may be wondering how to remove it. This blue circle with an “A” is a feature of the iPhone’s Do Not Disturb mode, which allows you to silence calls, notifications, and alerts from certain contacts. In this article, we will explain how to remove the blue circle with an “A” in it next to a caller you did not block.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step to removing the blue circle with an “A” in it next to a caller you did not block is to open the Settings app on your iPhone. Once you have opened the Settings app, scroll down and tap on “Do Not Disturb”. This will open the Do Not Disturb settings page.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5437583/pexels-photo-5437583.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="iphone-smartphone-app-i-os"><figcaption>picture by Brett Jordan</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">On the Do Not Disturb settings page, you will see a list of contacts that have been added to the Do Not Disturb list. If you see the contact you want to remove from the list, simply tap on the blue circle with an “A” next to their name. This will remove the contact from the Do Not Disturb list and the blue circle with an “A” will no longer appear next to their name.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you do not see the contact you want to remove from the Do Not Disturb list, you can add them manually. To do this, tap on the “Add Contact” button at the bottom of the Do Not Disturb settings page. This will open your contacts list, where you can select the contact you want to add to the Do Not Disturb list. Once you have selected the contact, tap on the blue circle with an “A” next to their name. This will add the contact to the Do Not Disturb list and the blue circle with an “A” will appear next to their name.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you have added or removed the contact from the Do Not Disturb list, the blue circle with an “A” will no longer appear next to their name. This will allow you to receive calls, notifications, and alerts from the contact without being disturbed.</p><br>
