                        <p class="article-text">If you have noticed a blue circle with an “A” in it next to a caller you did not block, you may be wondering how to remove it. This blue circle with an “A” is a feature of the iPhone’s Do Not Disturb mode, and it indicates that the caller has been added to your Do Not Disturb list. Fortunately, it is easy to remove the blue circle with an “A” from a caller you did not block.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Then, scroll down and tap on Do Not Disturb. On the Do Not Disturb page, you will see a list of contacts that have been added to your Do Not Disturb list. Find the contact with the blue circle with an “A” next to it, and tap on the “-” icon to the left of the contact’s name. This will remove the contact from your Do Not Disturb list, and the blue circle with an “A” will no longer appear next to the contact’s name.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8365541/pexels-photo-8365541.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="computer-laptop-on-wooden-table"><figcaption>picture by Nothing Ahead</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">If you want to prevent the blue circle with an “A” from appearing next to a contact’s name in the future, you can turn off the Do Not Disturb feature. To do this, go back to the Do Not Disturb page in the Settings app and toggle the switch at the top of the page to the “Off” position. This will turn off the Do Not Disturb feature, and the blue circle with an “A” will no longer appear next to any contacts.</p><br>
