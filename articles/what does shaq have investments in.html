<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Shaquille O'Neal, or Shaq as he is more commonly known, is one of the most recognizable figures in the world. He is a four-time NBA champion, an Olympic gold medalist, and a successful businessman. As such, it's no surprise that many people are curious about what Shaq has invested in. In this blog post, we'll take a look at some of the investments that Shaq has made over the years and how they have helped him become even more successful.</p>			
<h3> Shaq's Early Investments</h3>
<p>Shaq began investing early on in his career. He was already making millions of dollars from his NBA salary and endorsements, so he decided to put some of that money into investments. One of his earliest investments was in a company called 24-Hour Fitness. He invested $1 million into the company and eventually became its spokesperson. This investment paid off for him as 24-Hour Fitness went public in 2006 and made him even more money.</p>
<p>Shaq also invested in real estate early on in his career. He purchased several properties around the country and rented them out for additional income. This proved to be a wise decision as real estate prices have gone up significantly since then, making his investments even more profitable.</p>

<h3> Investing In Technology Companies</h3>
<p>In recent years, Shaq has become increasingly interested in investing in technology companies. He has invested in several startups such as Ring (a home security company), Lyft (a ride-sharing service), and LegalZoom (an online legal services provider). These investments have paid off for him as all three companies have gone public or been acquired by larger companies for significant sums of money.</p>
<p>Shaq has also invested heavily in esports teams such as NRG Esports and Team Liquid. Esports is an industry that is growing rapidly and Shaq believes that investing in these teams will help him capitalize on this growth potential. His investments have already paid off with NRG Esports winning multiple championships since he first invested in them back in 2016.</p>

<h3> Investing In Himself</h3>
<p>In addition to investing his money into other companies, Shaq has also made sure to invest heavily into himself over the years. He has taken courses at Harvard Business School to learn more about business and investing strategies so that he can make better decisions with his own money going forward. He also launched his own podcast called The Big Podcast with Shaq which allows him to share his knowledge with others while also making some extra income from it as well.</p>
