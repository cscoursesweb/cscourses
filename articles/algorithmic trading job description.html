<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or algo-trading, is the use of computer programs to execute trades on financial markets. These programs are designed to analyze market data and make decisions about when and how to buy or sell securities. Algorithmic trading has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to quickly and accurately execute trades without human intervention.</p>
<p>Algorithmic trading is used by both institutional investors and individual traders. Institutional investors use algorithmic trading to manage large portfolios of securities, while individual traders may use it to take advantage of short-term price movements in the market. Algorithmic trading can be used for a variety of strategies, including market making, arbitrage, trend following, and portfolio optimization.</p>
