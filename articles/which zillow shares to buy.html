<h3>Analyzing Zillow's Stock Performance</h3>
<p>Once you have done your research on the company's financials, you should then analyze its stock performance over time. This will give you an idea of how well it has performed in the past and whether or not it is likely to continue performing well in the future. You should also look at any analyst ratings or recommendations for the stock as these can provide valuable insight into whether or not it is a good investment.</p>			
<h3>Considering Your Investment Goals</h3>
<p>When deciding which Zillow shares to buy, it is important to consider your own investment goals and objectives. Are you looking for short-term gains or long-term growth? Are you looking for income or capital appreciation? Knowing what your goals are will help you narrow down your choices and make sure that you are investing in a stock that meets your needs.</p>			
<h3>Understanding Risk vs Reward</h3>
<p>Finally, when choosing which Zillow shares to buy, it is important to understand risk versus reward. Investing in stocks carries some risk but also has potential rewards if done correctly. It is important to understand both sides of this equation before making any decisions so that you can make an informed decision about which stocks are right for your portfolio.</p>
