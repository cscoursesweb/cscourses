                        <p class="article-text">Muting the external microphone when a headphone is plugged in is a great way to ensure that your audio recordings are of the highest quality. This is especially important if you are recording audio for a podcast, video, or other type of media. In this article, we will discuss why it is important to mute the external microphone when a headphone is plugged in, as well as how to do it.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, let’s discuss why it is important to mute the external microphone when a headphone is plugged in.
