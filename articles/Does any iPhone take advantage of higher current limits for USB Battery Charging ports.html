                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether any iPhone takes advantage of higher current limits for USB Battery Charging ports is yes. Apple has implemented a feature called USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) on some of its iPhones, which allows them to take advantage of higher current limits for USB Battery Charging ports.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">USB-PD is a new charging standard that was developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). It is designed to provide faster charging speeds and higher power delivery than the traditional USB charging standard. USB-PD is capable of delivering up to 100 watts of power, which is significantly higher than the 5 watts that the traditional USB charging standard can provide.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6347955/pexels-photo-6347955.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-employee-working-on-laptop-with-photo-on-screen-indoors"><figcaption>picture by Liza Summer</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Apple has implemented USB-PD on some of its iPhones, including the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, XS, XS Max, and XR. These iPhones are capable of taking advantage of higher current limits for USB Battery Charging ports, allowing them to charge faster than they would with the traditional USB charging standard.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to the iPhones mentioned above, Apple has also implemented USB-PD on its iPad Pro models. The iPad Pro models are capable of taking advantage of up to 100 watts of power, allowing them to charge even faster than the iPhones.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4453100/pexels-photo-4453100.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-girl-in-red-dress-holding-silver-ipad-pro"><figcaption>picture by Helena Lopes</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that not all USB Battery Charging ports are capable of providing the higher current limits that USB-PD requires. In order to take advantage of the higher current limits, you will need to use a USB Battery Charging port that is specifically designed for USB-PD.</p><br>
