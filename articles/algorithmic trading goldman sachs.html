<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or algo-trading, is a type of trading that uses computer algorithms to automatically generate trading signals and execute trades. Algorithmic trading is used by many large institutional investors, such as hedge funds and investment banks, to execute large orders in an efficient and cost-effective manner. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to reduce transaction costs and improve execution speed.</p>
<p>Algorithmic trading works by using computer algorithms to identify patterns in the market and generate buy or sell signals based on those patterns. The algorithms are programmed to take into account a variety of factors such as price movements, volume, news events, technical indicators, and other market data. Once the algorithm identifies a potential trade opportunity, it will automatically execute the trade without any human intervention.</p>
<p>The use of algorithmic trading has grown significantly over the past decade due to its ability to reduce transaction costs and improve execution speed. Goldman Sachs is one of the leading firms in algorithmic trading technology and has been at the forefront of developing new strategies for algorithmic traders.</p>
