<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Zillow is one of the most popular real estate websites in the world, and it has become a go-to resource for many people looking to buy or sell a home. But who owns Zillow? It's an important question to ask, as understanding the company's ownership structure can help you better understand how it operates and how decisions are made. In this blog post, we'll explore who owns Zillow and what that means for its users.</p>

<h3> The Company's Founders</h3>
<p>Zillow was founded in 2006 by Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink, two former Microsoft executives. The two had previously worked together at Expedia, where they had developed a successful online travel business. After leaving Microsoft, they decided to apply their knowledge of online businesses to the real estate market. They launched Zillow with the goal of making it easier for people to find homes and get information about them.</p>
<p>Today, Barton is still involved with Zillow as its executive chairman, while Frink serves as an advisor to the company. Both men remain major shareholders in the company and have significant influence over its operations.</p>			
<h3> Publicly Traded Shares</h3>
<p>In 2011, Zillow went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol “Z”. This means that anyone can buy shares of Zillow stock on the open market and become a shareholder in the company. As of this writing, there are over 100 million shares outstanding with a market capitalization of nearly $14 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The majority of these shares are owned by institutional investors such as mutual funds and hedge funds. These investors typically hold large blocks of shares for long periods of time and have significant influence over how the company is run. However, individual investors can also purchase shares on their own if they wish to become part-owners of Zillow.</p>

<h3> Private Equity Investors</h3>
<p>In addition to publicly traded shares, there are also private equity investors who own stakes in Zillow through private investments or venture capital funds. These investors typically take a more active role in managing their investments than public shareholders do and often have seats on the board of directors or other positions within the company that give them influence over decision-making processes at Zillow.</p>
<p>Private equity investors often provide capital for companies like Zillow when they need additional funding for expansion or other projects that require large amounts of money up front. In return for their investment, these investors receive equity stakes in the company which can be sold at a later date if desired or held onto as long-term investments depending on their goals and risk tolerance levels.</p>

<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ultimately, there is no single entity that controls Zillow; instead it is owned by a variety of different stakeholders including founders Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink; publicly traded shareholders; private equity investors; venture capitalists; employees; customers; partners; suppliers; lenders; etc.. Each group has its own interests when it comes to how Zillow should be run but ultimately all decisions must be approved by a majority vote from all stakeholders before they can be implemented into actionable plans or policies at the company level.</p>
