                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">The question of why ballots cannot be sent over the internet is a complex one, and there are a variety of reasons why this is not possible. In order to understand why ballots cannot be sent over the internet, it is important to understand the differences between sending money and sending ballots.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When sending money over the internet, the process is relatively simple. The sender enters the recipient’s information, such as their bank account number, and the amount of money to be sent. The money is then transferred electronically, and the recipient can access the funds almost immediately.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/230544/pexels-photo-230544.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-using-black-and-white-smartphone-and-holding-blue-card"><figcaption>picture by PhotoMIX Company</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Sending ballots over the internet, however, is much more complicated. Ballots are typically sent through the mail, and the process of verifying the identity of the voter and ensuring that the ballot is valid is much more involved. In order to ensure that the ballot is valid, the voter must provide a valid form of identification, such as a driver’s license or passport. The voter must also sign the ballot, and the signature must be verified by a third party.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition, ballots must be kept secure and confidential. This means that the ballots must be stored in a secure location, and the information must be encrypted to prevent tampering. This is much more difficult to do with an internet-based system, as it is much easier for hackers to gain access to the system.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/39584/censorship-limitations-freedom-of-expression-restricted-39584.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-android-smartphone-on-top-of-white-book"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, ballots must be counted accurately. This means that the ballots must be counted by hand, and the results must be verified by a third party. This is much more difficult to do with an internet-based system, as it is much easier for hackers to manipulate the results.</p><br>
