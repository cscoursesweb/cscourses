        <p class="article-text">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for node regression tasks, as they can capture complex relationships between nodes in a graph. However, GNNs are often considered to be “black boxes”, meaning that it is difficult to explain why a particular prediction was made. This lack of explainability can be a major obstacle for many applications, such as healthcare, where it is important to understand why a particular decision was made. Fortunately, there are a number of explainable GNN methods that can be used for node regression tasks.</p><br><p class="article-text">One of the most popular explainable GNN methods is Graph Attention Networks (GATs). GATs use attention mechanisms to learn the importance of each node in the graph, allowing them to focus on the most relevant nodes when making predictions. This makes it easier to understand why a particular prediction was made, as the attention weights can be used to identify which nodes were most important in the decision-making process.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another explainable GNN method is Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). GCNs use convolutional layers to learn the relationships between nodes in the graph. This allows them to capture complex patterns in the data, while still providing an interpretable model. By examining the weights of the convolutional layers, it is possible to understand which nodes are most important for making a particular prediction.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can also be used for explainable node regression tasks. GNNs use recurrent layers to capture the temporal dynamics of the graph, allowing them to learn the relationships between nodes over time. This makes it easier to understand why a particular prediction was made, as the recurrent layers can be used to identify which nodes were most important in the decision-making process.</p><br>
