<h3>Do AirPods 2nd Gen Have Spatial Audio?</h3>
<p>The short answer is yes! The AirPods 2nd Gen have spatial audio, which is a feature that allows you to experience surround sound in your headphones. This feature uses directional audio filters to create an immersive sound experience that makes it feel like you're in the middle of a movie theater or concert hall.

<h3>How Does Spatial Audio Work on AirPods 2nd Gen?</h3>
<p>Spatial audio works by using directional audio filters to create an immersive sound experience that makes it feel like you're in the middle of a movie theater or concert hall. The directional audio filters allow for more accurate sound localization, which means that sounds will appear to come from different directions depending on where they are located in relation to your head. This creates a more realistic surround sound experience than traditional stereo headphones can provide.</p>
<p>The adaptive EQ feature also helps create an immersive experience by adjusting the sound based on what type of music you're listening to. For example, if you're listening to classical music, it will adjust the EQ settings so that strings and woodwinds stand out more clearly than other instruments in the mix. This helps create a more realistic surround sound experience as well as making sure that all instruments can be heard clearly without any one instrument overpowering another one in the mix.</p>			
<h3>Where Can I Buy AirPods 2nd Gen With Spatial Audio?</h3>
