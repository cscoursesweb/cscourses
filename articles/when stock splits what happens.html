<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. It is typically done when a company's stock price has risen to levels that may be too high for certain investors to buy into. By splitting the stock, the price per share is reduced, making it more affordable for investors. For example, if a company with one million shares outstanding splits its stock 2-for-1, it will then have two million shares outstanding and each share will be worth half of what it was before the split.</p>

<h3>Why Do Companies Split Their Stock?</h3>
<p>The primary reason companies split their stock is to make it more accessible and affordable for investors. When a company's stock price rises too high, it can become difficult for smaller investors to purchase enough shares to make an impact on their portfolio. By splitting the stock, the price per share is reduced, making it more affordable for these investors. Additionally, some companies believe that by splitting their stock they can increase their visibility in the market and attract more investors.</p>			
<h3>What Happens When a Stock Splits?</h3>
<p>When a company splits its stock, there are several things that happen: 1. The number of outstanding shares increases: When a company splits its stock, the number of outstanding shares increases proportionally with the split ratio (e.g., 2-for-1). This means that if there were 1 million shares outstanding before the split and they do a 2-for-1 split, there will now be 2 million shares outstanding after the split. 2. The price per share decreases: Since there are now more shares outstanding after the split than before, each individual share is worth less than before (e.g., if you had 1 share worth $100 before the split and they do a 2-for-1 split, you will now have 2 shares worth $50 each). 3. The market capitalization remains unchanged: Despite changes in both number of outstanding shares and price per share after a split, the market capitalization (i.e., total value) of the company remains unchanged since these two factors offset each other (e.g., if you had 1 million shares worth $100 each before the split and they do a 2-for-1 split, you will now have 2 million shares worth $50 each but still have an overall market capitalization of $100 million). 4. The shareholder equity remains unchanged: Similarly to market capitalization, shareholder equity also remains unchanged since any changes in number of outstanding shares or price per share offset each other (e.g., if you had 1 million shareholders owning 1 million total shares worth $100 each before the split and they do a 2-for-1 split, you will now have 2 million shareholders owning 2 million total shares worth $50 each but still have an overall shareholder equity of $100 million).</p>

<h3>What Are The Benefits Of A Stock Split?</h3>
<p>There are several benefits associated with stock splits: 1. Increased liquidity: By reducing the price per share through splitting stocks, companies can make their stocks more accessible and attractive to smaller investors who may not be able to afford higher priced stocks otherwise; this increased liquidity can lead to increased trading volume which can benefit both shareholders and companies alike as increased trading volume often leads to higher prices due to increased demand for stocks; this increased demand can also lead to higher valuations for companies as well as higher dividends paid out by them as well; 2. Increased visibility: Splitting stocks can also help increase visibility in markets as lower priced stocks tend to attract more attention from potential investors; this increased visibility can lead to increased trading volume which again leads to higher prices due to increased demand; 3. Lower risk: Splitting stocks also reduces risk associated with investing in high priced stocks as lower priced stocks tend to be less volatile than higher priced ones; this reduced risk makes investing in such stocks attractive for smaller investors who may not want or be able take on too much risk; 4 Increased shareholder confidence: Finally, splitting stocks can also help increase shareholder confidence as lower priced stocks tend to be seen as less risky investments which can lead shareholders feeling more secure about their investments; this increased confidence often leads shareholders holding onto their investments longer which helps create stability within markets which again benefits both shareholders and companies alike by creating long term value for all involved parties;</p>
<p>Overall, while there are some risks associated with splitting stocks such as potential dilution of earnings per share or decreased liquidity due to decreased trading volume after initial surge following announcement of splits - these risks are usually outweighed by potential benefits such as increased liquidity due lower prices making them attractive for smaller investors or increased visibility leading potential new investors into markets - thus making them attractive options for many companies looking at increasing value within markets over long term periods rather than short term gains from single events such as mergers or acquisitions etc..</p>
