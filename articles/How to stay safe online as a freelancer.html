                        <p class="article-text">As a freelancer, you are likely to be spending a lot of time online, whether it’s for research, networking, or actually doing your work. With so much of your life and livelihood depending on the internet, it’s important to take steps to stay safe online. Here are some tips to help you stay safe as a freelancer.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">1. Use strong passwords.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/39584/censorship-limitations-freedom-of-expression-restricted-39584.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-android-smartphone-on-top-of-white-book"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Strong passwords are essential for protecting your online accounts. Make sure to use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, and change your passwords regularly.</p><br><p class="article-text">2. Be aware of phishing scams.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6964369/pexels-photo-6964369.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-black-hoodie-holding-a-smartphone"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Phishing scams are a common way for scammers to try to get your personal information. Be wary of any emails or messages that ask for your personal information or credit card details. If you’re ever unsure, contact the sender directly to verify the request.</p><br><p class="article-text">3. Use two-factor authentication.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/927629/pexels-photo-927629.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-laptop-near-plant"><figcaption>picture by Tobias Dziuba</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires you to enter a code sent to your phone or email address in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for someone to access your accounts, even if they have your password.</p><br><p class="article-text">4. Use a VPN.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7788009/pexels-photo-7788009.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gold-bitcoin-coin-on-background-of-growth-chart"><figcaption>picture by Ivan Babydov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">A virtual private network (VPN) is a great way to protect your online activity from being tracked or monitored. A VPN encrypts your data and routes it through a secure server, making it much harder for hackers to access your information.</p><br><p class="article-text">5. Back up your data.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/60504/security-protection-anti-virus-software-60504.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="security-logo"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Backing up your data is essential for protecting your work in case of a computer crash or other disaster. Make sure to back up your data regularly, either to an external hard drive or to a cloud storage service.</p><br><p class="article-text">6. Be careful when using public Wi-Fi.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/276254/pexels-photo-276254.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="arachnid-blur-close-up-cobweb"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Public Wi-Fi networks can be a great way to get online when you’re out and about, but they can also be a security risk. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as banking or credit card details, when using public Wi-Fi.</p><br><p class="article-text">7. Use secure payment methods.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2068975/pexels-photo-2068975.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-holding-100-us-dollar-banknotes"><figcaption>picture by Alexander Mils</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to getting paid, make sure to use secure payment methods. Credit cards and PayPal are both secure options, as they offer buyer protection and fraud prevention.</p><br>
