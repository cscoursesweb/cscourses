<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Amazon is one of the world’s largest and most successful companies, and its founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, is one of the wealthiest people in the world. But who exactly owns Amazon? The answer to this question is a bit more complicated than you might think.</p>
<p>Amazon is a publicly traded company, meaning that it has shares that are available for purchase on the stock market. This means that anyone can buy shares in Amazon and become an owner of the company. However, there are some major shareholders who own a large portion of Amazon’s stock. The largest shareholder is Jeff Bezos himself, who owns 16% of Amazon’s outstanding shares. He also owns another 5% through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions.</p>
<p>The second-largest shareholder in Amazon is Vanguard Group Inc., which owns 6% of the company’s outstanding shares. Vanguard Group Inc. is an investment management company that manages mutual funds and other investments for its clients. BlackRock Inc., another investment management company, holds 5% of Amazon’s outstanding shares as well.</p>			
<h3> How Does Jeff Bezos Own So Much Of Amazon?</h3>
<p>Jeff Bezos has been with Amazon since its inception in 1994 and has been its CEO since 1997. He was able to accumulate such a large stake in the company by investing his own money into it early on and by exercising stock options over time as part of his compensation package as CEO.</p>
<p>Bezos also had access to capital from venture capitalists early on in Amazon’s history which allowed him to purchase additional shares at discounted prices before they were available to the public on the stock market. This allowed him to accumulate a larger stake than he would have been able to otherwise.</p>
<p>Bezos also had access to capital from other sources such as private equity firms which allowed him to purchase additional shares at discounted prices before they were available to the public on the stock market as well as through secondary offerings where existing shareholders can sell their shares directly back to the company at a discounted price before they are made available on the open market again.</p>

<h3> What Are The Benefits Of Being A Major Shareholder In A Company?</h3>
<p>Being a major shareholder in any company comes with certain benefits that are not available to other shareholders or investors in general. For example, major shareholders often have more influence over decisions made by management due to their larger ownership stake in the company which gives them more voting power when it comes time for important decisions such as electing board members or approving mergers or acquisitions.</p>
<p>Major shareholders also have access to information about their companies that may not be available publicly which can give them an advantage when making decisions about their investments or when trading their stocks on the open market. They may also be able to negotiate better terms for themselves when it comes time for dividends or other distributions from their companies due to their larger ownership stake compared with other investors or shareholders who may not have as much influence over management decisions or access to information about their companies as major shareholders do.</p>
<p>Finally, being a major shareholder can provide financial security if done correctly since they will be entitled to receive dividends from their companies if they declare them and will benefit from any increase in share price due to positive news about their companies or industry trends that could lead investors towards buying more shares of those companies instead of others within similar industries or sectors.</p>			
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>Jeff Bezos is currently one of the largest owners of Amazon with 16% ownership stake through his personal holdings and another 5% through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. He was able to accumulate such a large stake by investing his own money into it early on and by exercising stock options over time as part of his compensation package as CEO along with access to capital from venture capitalists early on in Amazon’s history which allowed him purchase additional shares at discounted prices before they were available publicly on the stock market along with secondary offerings where existing shareholders can sell their shares directly back to the company at a discounted price before they are made available again on open markets . Being a major shareholder comes with certain benefits such as having more influence over decisions made by management due having larger voting power when it comes time for important decisions such electing board members or approving mergers/acquisitions along with access information about their companies that may not be available publicly which can give them an advantage when making decisions about investments/trading stocks along with potential financial security if done correctly since they will be entitled receive dividends from declared distributions/benefit from increase share price due positive news/industry trends leading investors towards buying more those stocks instead others within similar industries/sectors .</p>
