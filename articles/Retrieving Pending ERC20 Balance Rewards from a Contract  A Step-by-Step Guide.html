                        <p class="article-text">Retrieving pending ERC20 balance rewards from a contract can be a tricky process, but it is possible. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to successfully retrieve your pending ERC20 balance rewards from a contract.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you will need to find the contract address of the contract you are trying to retrieve your rewards from. This can usually be found on the website of the project or token you are trying to retrieve rewards from. Once you have the contract address, you will need to use a blockchain explorer to view the contract’s code.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14891553/pexels-photo-14891553.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="bitcoin-on-yellow-background"><figcaption>picture by Jonathan Borba</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have the contract code, you will need to look for the function that is responsible for distributing rewards. This function will usually be named something like “distributeRewards” or “distributeTokens”. Once you have found the function, you will need to look for the code that is responsible for distributing the rewards.</p><br><p class="article-text">The code responsible for distributing rewards will usually include a loop that iterates through a list of addresses and sends rewards to each address. You will need to find the address that corresponds to your wallet address and make sure that the reward is still pending. If the reward is still pending, you will need to call the function with your wallet address as an argument. This will trigger the contract to send the reward to your wallet.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you have successfully retrieved your pending ERC20 balance rewards from a contract, you will need to make sure that the rewards are properly credited to your wallet. You can do this by checking your wallet’s balance and making sure that the rewards have been added.</p><br>
