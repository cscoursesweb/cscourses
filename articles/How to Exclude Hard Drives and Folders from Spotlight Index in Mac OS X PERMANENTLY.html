                        <p class="article-text">If you’re a Mac user, you’re probably familiar with Spotlight, the built-in search feature that helps you quickly find files, folders, and applications on your computer. While Spotlight is a great tool for quickly locating items on your Mac, it can also be a bit of a nuisance if it’s indexing files and folders that you don’t need or want to search for. Fortunately, there is a way to exclude hard drives and folders from Spotlight index in Mac OS X permanently.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step to excluding hard drives and folders from Spotlight index is to open System Preferences. To do this, click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and select System Preferences. Once the System Preferences window is open, click on the Spotlight icon. This will open the Spotlight preferences window.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4339335/pexels-photo-4339335.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="network-cables-as-supply-for-work-of-system"><figcaption>picture by Brett Sayles</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In the Spotlight preferences window, you will see a list of all the hard drives and folders that are currently being indexed by Spotlight. To exclude a hard drive or folder from Spotlight index, simply uncheck the box next to it. Once you have unchecked the box, the hard drive or folder will no longer be indexed by Spotlight.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you want to exclude a hard drive or folder from Spotlight index permanently, you will need to open the Terminal application. To do this, open the Applications folder and then open the Utilities folder. In the Utilities folder, you will find the Terminal application. Once the Terminal application is open, type in the following command:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12608612/pexels-photo-12608612.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="security-gates-on-an-airport"><figcaption>picture by Gonzalo Carlos Novillo Lapeyra</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/[name of hard drive or folder]</p><br><p class="article-text">Replace [name of hard drive or folder] with the name of the hard drive or folder that you want to exclude from Spotlight index. Once you have entered the command, press enter. This will permanently exclude the hard drive or folder from Spotlight index.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/733745/pexels-photo-733745.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-sports-coupe"><figcaption>picture by Cesar Perez</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you ever want to re-index a hard drive or folder, you can do so by entering the following command in the Terminal application:</p><br><p class="article-text">sudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/[name of hard drive or folder]</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3361486/pexels-photo-3361486.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gray-external-drive-mounted-on-laptop"><figcaption>picture by Jessica Lewis Creative</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Replace [name of hard drive or folder] with the name of the hard drive or folder that you want to re-index. Once you have entered the command, press enter. This will re-index the hard drive or folder and it will once again be included in Spotlight searches.</p><br>
