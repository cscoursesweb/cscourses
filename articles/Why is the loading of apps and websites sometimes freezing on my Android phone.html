                        <p class="article-text">If you’ve ever experienced your apps and websites freezing on your Android phone, you’re not alone. This is a common issue that many Android users face, and it can be incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to try and fix the problem.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first thing to consider is whether or not your phone is running the latest version of the Android operating system. If it’s not, then you should update it as soon as possible. This will ensure that your phone is running the most up-to-date software, which can help to prevent freezing.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4057656/pexels-photo-4057656.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-vintage-typewriter-with-corona-update-typed-on-white-paper"><figcaption>picture by Markus Winkler</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another potential cause of freezing is a lack of available storage space. If your phone’s internal storage is full, then it won’t be able to run apps and websites properly. To free up some space, you can delete any unnecessary files or apps that you don’t use.</p><br><p class="article-text">It’s also possible that your phone’s RAM is overloaded. RAM is the memory that your phone uses to run apps and websites, and if it’s overloaded then it can cause freezing. To fix this, you can try closing any apps that you’re not using.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3218340/pexels-photo-3218340.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="goat-with-big-horn"><figcaption>picture by Johannes Havn</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s possible that your phone’s processor is too slow. If your phone is more than a few years old, then it may not be able to handle the latest apps and websites. In this case, you may need to upgrade your phone to a newer model.</p><br>
