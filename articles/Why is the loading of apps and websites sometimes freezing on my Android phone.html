                        <p class="article-text">Sometimes, the issue may be with the website itself, rather than your Android phone. If a website is down or experiencing technical issues, it can cause it to freeze or take a long time to load. To fix this issue, try accessing the website on a different device or wait a few minutes and try again.</p><br>
