<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Starting a business is an exciting venture, but it can also be a daunting one. One of the most important decisions you will make when starting your business is whether to become a public limited company (PLC). A PLC is a type of company that is listed on the stock exchange and has limited liability. It offers many advantages, such as access to capital and increased credibility, but there are also some stringent requirements that must be met in order to become a PLC. In this blog post, we will discuss what these requirements are and how you can meet them.</p>			
<h3>What Is a Public Limited Company?</h3>
<p>A public limited company (PLC) is a type of company that is listed on the stock exchange and has limited liability. It offers many advantages, such as access to capital and increased credibility, but there are also some stringent requirements that must be met in order to become a PLC.</p>
<p>A PLC is different from other types of companies because it can offer its shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO). This means that anyone can buy shares in the company, which gives it access to more capital than other types of companies. Additionally, being listed on the stock exchange gives the company more credibility with potential customers and investors.</p>			
<h3>Requirements for Becoming a Public Limited Company</h3>
<p>In order to become a PLC, there are certain requirements that must be met. These include:</p>
<p>1. Minimum Share Capital: The minimum share capital required for becoming a PLC varies from country to country, but typically ranges from £50,000-£100,000. This amount must be paid up before any shares can be issued or traded on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>2. Minimum Number of Shareholders: A PLC must have at least two shareholders in order to become incorporated as one. Additionally, at least 25% of its issued share capital must be held by at least 50 people who are not directors or employees of the company.</p>
<p>3. Minimum Number of Directors: A PLC must have at least two directors who are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the business and making sure it complies with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>4. Memorandum & Articles of Association: The memorandum & articles of association (M&A) outlines how the company will operate and sets out its objectives and powers as well as those of its directors and shareholders. It also contains information about how decisions will be made within the company and how disputes between shareholders will be resolved if they arise. The M&A must be approved by all shareholders before it can take effect.</p>
<p>5 .Audited Financial Statements: All companies listed on the stock exchange must submit audited financial statements each year in order to remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations as well as maintain their listing status on the exchange itself . These statements provide investors with an accurate picture of how well or poorly the business is performing financially so they can make informed decisions about whether or not they want to invest in it .</p>
<p>6 .Insurance Cover: All companies listed on the stock exchange must have adequate insurance cover in place in case something goes wrong with their operations or investments . This helps protect both investors’ money as well as any assets owned by the company itself .</p>
<p>7 .Compliance With Stock Exchange Rules & Regulations : All companies listed on the stock exchange must comply with all applicable laws , regulations , rules , guidelines , codes , etc . set out by their respective exchanges . Failure to do so could result in fines , suspension or even delisting from said exchanges .</p>
<p>8 .Continuous Disclosure Obligations : Companies listed on stock exchanges have certain continuous disclosure obligations which require them to keep investors informed about any material changes within their businesses such as changes in management , financial performance , etc . This helps ensure transparency within these businesses so investors can make informed decisions about whether or not they want to invest in them .</p>
