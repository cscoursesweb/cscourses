<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this blog post, we’ll take a look at which Tesla has the longest range and what factors you should consider when making your decision.</p>

<h3>Tesla Model X</h3>

<h3>Tesla Model 3</h3>
<p>The Tesla Model 3 was released in 2017 and is currently one of the most popular electric vehicles on the market. It has a range of up to 310 miles on a single charge, making it slightly less than both the Model S and X but still more than enough for most people’s needs.

<h3>Tesla Roadster</h3>
<p>The Tesla Roadster was released in 2020 and is currently one of the longest-range electric vehicles on the market with an impressive range of 620 miles on a single charge! The Roadster also offers plenty of features such as Autopilot, an all-glass roof, and a 17-inch touchscreen display. It also has plenty of cargo space with up to 30 cubic feet available with the rear seats folded down.</p>
<p>When deciding which Tesla model is right for you, there are several factors that you should consider including your budget, how much cargo space you need, how often you plan on driving long distances or taking road trips, and what features are important to you (such as Autopilot). Ultimately though if you’re looking for maximum range then your best bet would be either the Tesla Model S or Roadster depending on your budget and other needs/wants!</p>
