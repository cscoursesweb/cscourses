                        <p class="article-text">Security Vulnerabilities for HTTP Login of Self-Hosted Nextcloud Server Over Tor</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The Nextcloud server is a popular open-source file sharing and collaboration platform. It is self-hosted, meaning that users can install and manage their own server. This allows users to have full control over their data and the security of their server. However, when using the Nextcloud server over Tor, there are certain security vulnerabilities that must be taken into account.</p><br><p class="article-text">One of the most common security vulnerabilities when using the Nextcloud server over Tor is the use of HTTP login. HTTP is an unencrypted protocol, meaning that any data sent over it can be intercepted and read by anyone with access to the network. This means that any login credentials sent over HTTP can be easily stolen by malicious actors. To protect against this, it is important to use HTTPS instead of HTTP when logging into the Nextcloud server. HTTPS is an encrypted protocol, meaning that any data sent over it is secure and cannot be intercepted.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another security vulnerability when using the Nextcloud server over Tor is the use of weak passwords. Passwords are the first line of defense against malicious actors, and it is important to use strong passwords that are difficult to guess. Weak passwords can be easily guessed by malicious actors, allowing them to gain access to the server. It is also important to use two-factor authentication when logging into the Nextcloud server, as this adds an extra layer of security.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7951468/pexels-photo-7951468.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="two-women-wearing-headscarves-sitting-on-blue-sofa"><figcaption>picture by RODNAE Productions</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to keep the Nextcloud server up to date with the latest security patches. Outdated software can contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. It is important to regularly check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This will ensure that the server is secure and protected against any potential security vulnerabilities.</p><br>
