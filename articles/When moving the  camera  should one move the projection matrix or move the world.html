                <title>When moving the "camera" should one move the projection matrix or move the world?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="When moving the "camera" in a 3D environment, it is important to understand the difference between moving the projection matrix and moving the world. The projection matrix is responsible for projecting the 3D world onto the 2D screen, and is typically manipulated to change the field of view or the perspective of the camera. Moving the world, on the other hand, is the process of changing the position of the camera within the 3D world. This can be done by translating the world matrix, which is responsible for the position and orientation of the camera in the 3D world. Understanding the difference between these two concepts is essential for creating a realistic 3D environment.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to moving the “camera” in a 3D environment, there is a debate as to whether one should move the projection matrix or move the world. The answer to this question depends on the type of 3D environment you are working with and the desired effect you are trying to achieve.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">If you are working with a 3D environment that is based on a fixed camera, then it is best to move the projection matrix. This will allow you to move the camera around the 3D environment without having to move the world. This is especially useful if you are trying to create a cinematic effect, as it allows you to move the camera around the environment without having to move the objects in the environment.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4826434/pexels-photo-4826434.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="cloudy-sky-over-rocky-shore"><figcaption>picture by kien virak</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">On the other hand, if you are working with a 3D environment that is based on a moving camera, then it is best to move the world. This will allow you to move the camera around the 3D environment while still keeping the objects in the environment in the same place. This is especially useful if you are trying to create a realistic effect, as it allows you to move the camera around the environment while still keeping the objects in the environment in the same place.</p><br>
