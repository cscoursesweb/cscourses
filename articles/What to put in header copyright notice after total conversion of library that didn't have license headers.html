                <meta name="description" content="A header copyright notice is an important part of any library, as it provides legal protection for the library's creators and users. After a library has undergone a total conversion, it is important to update the header copyright notice to reflect the new changes. This article will provide an overview of what should be included in a header copyright notice after a total conversion of a library that did not have a license header. We will discuss the types of information that should be included, as well as the best practices for creating and maintaining a header copyright notice. Finally, we will provide some tips for ensuring that the header copyright notice is up-to-date and legally compliant.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to copyright notices, it can be difficult to know what to put in the header after a total conversion of a library that didn’t have license headers. Copyright notices are important for protecting the intellectual property of the creator of the library, and it’s important to make sure that the copyright notice is accurate and up-to-date.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in determining what to put in the header copyright notice is to determine who owns the copyright to the library. If the library was created by an individual, then the individual owns the copyright. If the library was created by a company, then the company owns the copyright. Once the copyright owner is determined, the copyright notice should include the name of the copyright owner, the year the library was created, and a statement that the library is protected by copyright law.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/762687/pexels-photo-762687.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="open-textbook"><figcaption>picture by Jess Bailey Designs</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to determine what type of license the library is under. If the library is open source, then the copyright notice should include the name of the open source license, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). If the library is proprietary, then the copyright notice should include a statement that the library is proprietary and all rights are reserved.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the copyright notice should include a statement that the library is provided “as is” and without any warranties or guarantees. This statement is important to protect the copyright owner from any liability that may arise from the use of the library.</p><br>
