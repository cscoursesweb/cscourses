<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Are you looking for a way to find startup programs in Windows 10? If so, you’ve come to the right place. In this blog post, I’ll explain how to locate startup programs in Windows 10 and provide some tips on how to manage them.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is the latest version of Microsoft’s popular operating system. It comes with a variety of features and tools that make it easier for users to customize their experience. One of these features is the ability to manage startup programs.</p>
<p>Startup programs are applications that are automatically launched when Windows starts up. They can be useful for quickly launching frequently used applications or services, but they can also slow down your computer if there are too many of them running at once. Knowing how to find and manage startup programs in Windows 10 can help you keep your computer running smoothly.</p>

<h3>What Are Startup Programs?</h3>
<p>Startup programs are applications that are automatically launched when Windows starts up. They can be useful for quickly launching frequently used applications or services, but they can also slow down your computer if there are too many of them running at once. Knowing how to find and manage startup programs in Windows 10 can help you keep your computer running smoothly.</p>
<p>Startup programs can be installed by the user or by an application during installation. Some applications will add themselves to the list of startup programs without asking permission from the user, while others will ask for permission before adding themselves to the list. It’s important to know which applications have been added as startup programs so that you can decide whether or not they should remain on the list.</p>

<h3>Where Are Startup Programs Located in Windows 10?</h3>
<p>Startup programs are located in the Task Manager window in Windows 10. To open Task Manager, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard or right-click on the taskbar and select “Task Manager” from the menu that appears. Once Task Manager is open, click on the “Startup” tab at the top of the window. This will display a list of all of the applications that have been added as startup programs in Windows 10.</p>

<h3>How To Manage Startup Programs In Windows 10</h3>
<p>Once you have located all of your startup programs, you can decide which ones should remain on the list and which ones should be removed from it. To remove an application from the list, simply right-click on it and select “Disable” from the menu that appears. This will prevent it from launching when Windows starts up but will not uninstall it from your computer completely; it will still be available for use whenever you need it but won’t launch automatically anymore unless you re-enable it manually through Task Manager again later on down the line if needed.. You can also use Task Manager to change how an application launches when Windows starts up by selecting either “Normal Start” or “Delayed Start” from its context menu instead of disabling it completely; this allows you to control when an application launches without having to remove it entirely from your system's startup process altogether if desired..</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, knowing where and how to find and manage startup programs in Windows 10 is essential for keeping your computer running smoothly and efficiently over time; by taking a few moments out of each day (or week) to review what's currently set up as a part of your system's automatic launch process, you'll be able to ensure that only those items which truly need immediate access upon booting up remain active while everything else remains dormant until called upon as needed instead..</p>
<p> With this knowledge now firmly under your belt, go forth and take control over what gets launched when with confidence!</p>
