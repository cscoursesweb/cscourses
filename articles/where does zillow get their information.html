<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When it comes to real estate, Zillow is one of the most popular and trusted sources of information. But where does Zillow get its data? It’s a question that many people have asked, and it’s an important one to answer. After all, if you’re going to trust a source of information, you want to know where it’s coming from. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at where Zillow gets its data and how it uses that data to provide accurate and up-to-date information about homes for sale.</p>

<h3>What Is Zillow?</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the specifics of where Zillow gets its data, let’s take a quick look at what Zillow is. Founded in 2006, Zillow is an online real estate marketplace that provides users with access to millions of homes for sale across the United States. The company also offers tools such as mortgage calculators and home value estimates that help users make informed decisions about their real estate purchases.</p>

<h3>How Does Zillow Gather Its Data?</h3>
<p>So how does Zillow gather all this data? The company has several different sources for its information. First, it collects public records from county assessors and other government agencies. This includes property tax records, deed records, and other documents related to real estate transactions. Second, it collects listing information from multiple listing services (MLS) around the country. MLSs are databases used by real estate agents and brokers to list properties for sale or rent in their local area. Finally, the company also collects user-generated content such as reviews and photos from its users.</p>

<h3>How Does Zillow Use Its Data?</h3>
<p>Once it has gathered all this data from various sources, how does Zillow use it? The company uses its data in several ways: first, it uses the public records to create detailed profiles of each home listed on its site; second, it uses MLS listings to provide up-to-date information about homes for sale; third, it uses user-generated content such as reviews and photos to give potential buyers an inside look at what each home is like; finally, it uses all this data combined with proprietary algorithms to generate accurate home value estimates for each property listed on its site.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Zillow is one of the most trusted sources of real estate information available today thanks in part to the way they gather their data from multiple sources including public records, MLS listings, and user-generated content. By combining these sources with proprietary algorithms they are able to generate accurate home value estimates that help buyers make informed decisions when purchasing a home.</p>
