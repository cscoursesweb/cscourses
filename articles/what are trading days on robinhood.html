<h3>What Are Trading Days?</h3>
<p>Trading days are the days when you can buy and sell stocks, options, ETFs, and other securities in the stock market. The US stock market is open from 9:30 AM to 4 PM ET on weekdays (Monday through Friday). On weekends and holidays, the markets are closed.</p>
<p>When you use Robinhood to trade stocks or other securities, you must adhere to these same trading hours as well as any additional restrictions that may be imposed by your broker or exchange. For example, some exchanges may have different closing times than those listed above or may impose additional restrictions such as minimum order sizes or maximum order sizes.</p>			
<h3>How Do Trading Days Work?</h3>
<p>When you use Robinhood to trade stocks or other securities during a trading day, you must place your orders before 4 PM ET in order for them to be executed that day. Any orders placed after 4 PM ET will not be executed until the next trading day (unless there is an extended-hours session).</p>
<p>You can place orders at any time during a trading day using Robinhood's mobile app or website; however, it's important to note that orders placed after 4 PM ET will not be executed until the next trading day unless there is an extended-hours session available for that security (which is rare). Additionally, some exchanges may have different closing times than those listed above or may impose additional restrictions such as minimum order sizes or maximum order sizes.</p>			
<h3>Tips for Making the Most of Your Trading Days on Robinhood</h3>
<p>Now that we've discussed what trading days are and how they work with Robinhood let's look at some tips for making the most of your trading days:</p>
<p>1) Research Before You Buy: Before placing any trades with Robinhood it's important to do your research first so you know exactly what you're buying into and why it makes sense for your portfolio. This includes researching a company's financials as well as its competitive landscape so you can make an informed decision about whether it's a good investment for you or not.</p>
<p>2) Set Limits: When placing trades with Robinhood it's important to set limits so that you don't end up overtrading or taking too much risk with your investments. This means setting limits such as maximum daily losses/gains as well as maximum position size so that you don't end up overexposing yourself in any one security or sector of the market.</p>
<p>3) Monitor Your Positions: Once you've placed trades with Robinhood it's important to monitor them closely so that if something changes in the market (such as news about a company) then you can adjust accordingly before it has too much of an impact on your portfolio performance.</p>
<p>4) Take Advantage of Extended Hours Sessions: If available for certain securities then take advantage of extended hours sessions which allow traders to place orders outside of regular market hours (typically between 8 AM - 9:30 AM ET). This can be beneficial if there is news about a company outside of regular market hours which could affect its stock price significantly before regular market hours begin again at 9:30 AM ET.</p>
<p>5) Use Stop Losses & Limit Orders: Stop losses & limit orders allow traders to set predetermined prices at which their positions will be sold automatically if they reach certain levels in order to protect against large losses due to sudden price movements in either direction (upwards or downwards). This can help traders manage their risk more effectively by ensuring they don't take too much risk with any one position in their portfolio while still allowing them to take advantage of potential upside opportunities when they arise in certain securities/sectors of the market.</p>
<p>By following these tips traders should be able to make more informed decisions when placing trades with Robinhood during their trading days while also managing their risk more effectively by setting limits & using stop losses & limit orders where appropriate.I highly recommend exploring these related articles, which will provide valuable insights and help you gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.:<a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/algorithmic%20trading%20how%20to%20start.html'>www.cscourses.dev/algorithmic-trading-how-to-start.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/what%20are%20robinhood%20trading%20hours.html'>www.cscourses.dev/what-are-robinhood-trading-hours.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/how%20to%20get%20started%20with%20algorithmic%20trading.html'>www.cscourses.dev/how-to-get-started-with-algorithmic-trading.html</a></p>
