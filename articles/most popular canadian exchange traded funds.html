<h3>What is an Exchange Traded Fund?</h3>
<p>An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on an exchange, just like stocks. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they allow investors to invest in a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market prices. This makes them more liquid than traditional mutual funds and allows investors to take advantage of short-term price movements in the markets.</p>
<p>ETFs offer investors several advantages over traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. For example, they provide instant diversification across multiple asset classes with one purchase; they have lower management fees than traditional mutual funds; and they can be bought and sold quickly throughout the day on an exchange at market prices.</p>			
<h3>Advantages of Investing in Canadian Exchange Traded Funds</h3>
<p>Investing in Canadian exchange traded funds offers several advantages over investing in individual stocks or bonds. First, ETFs provide instant diversification across multiple asset classes with one purchase; this means that you don’t have to buy individual stocks or bonds in order to diversify your portfolio. Second, ETFs typically have lower management fees than traditional mutual funds; this means that you can save money by investing in ETFs instead of traditional mutual funds. Third, ETFs can be bought and sold quickly throughout the day on an exchange at market prices; this means that you can take advantage of short-term price movements in the markets without having to wait for days or weeks for your order to be filled like you would with traditional investments such as stocks or bonds.</p>
