This means they take deposits from customers and use that money to create loans for individuals and businesses. Commercial banks often offer savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards to their customers, and they make money by charging interest on the loans they provide.<br><br>💵💰 In general, investment banks tend to be more focused on high-level financial transactions, while commercial banks are more focused on day-to-day financial needs.

These banks also offer traditional banking services such as checking accounts, savings accounts, debit cards, credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, and more.<br><br>The FDIC is responsible for regulating and supervising commercial banks, which helps to ensure that depositors' funds are safe and protected. As a result, if a commercial bank were to fail or go out of business, the FDIC would typically insure depositors' funds up to a certain limit.<br><br>💼📈💵 <br><br>Investment banks, on the other hand, do not accept deposits but instead work with corporations and governments to help them raise capital by underwriting and selling securities such as stocks or bonds.
