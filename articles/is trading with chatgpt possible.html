<h3> What is ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT is an automated trading platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make decisions about when to buy and sell stocks, currencies, and other financial instruments.

The platform has been designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it accessible for both experienced traders and beginners alike.</p>

<h3> How Does ChatGPT Work?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT works by using AI algorithms to analyze market data in real-time. The system then makes decisions about when to buy or sell based on the data it collects. It also takes into account factors such as news events, economic indicators, and technical analysis. This allows it to make more informed decisions than a human trader would be able to do on their own.</p>
