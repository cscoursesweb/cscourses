<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Investment portfolio managers are responsible for managing the investments of individuals, companies, and other organizations. They make decisions about which investments to buy and sell, and they monitor the performance of those investments. As such, they play an important role in helping their clients achieve their financial goals. So, how much do investment portfolio managers make?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the organization they work for, their experience level, and the type of investments they manage. Generally speaking, investment portfolio managers can expect to earn anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 per year. However, some portfolio managers may earn significantly more than this depending on their experience level and the size of their organization.</p>			
<h3>Factors That Affect Investment Portfolio Manager Salaries</h3>

<p>* Experience Level: The more experience a portfolio manager has in managing investments, the higher their salary will be. Experienced portfolio managers are able to make better decisions about which investments to buy and sell in order to maximize returns for their clients.</p>
<p>* Size Of Organization: The size of the organization that a portfolio manager works for can also have an impact on their salary. Generally speaking, larger organizations tend to pay higher salaries than smaller ones due to the increased responsibility that comes with managing larger portfolios.</p>
