<p>Tesla Motors, the world-renowned electric car manufacturer, was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers and entrepreneurs. The company's founders include Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel, and Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Marc Tarpenning was another early investor in Tesla Motors and served as its CFO for several years. He had previously worked at companies such as Apple, Sun Microsystems, and NuvoMedia. Tarpenning also helped to develop the company's business plan and secure funding from investors.</p>
<p>JB Straubel is an engineer who has been involved with Tesla since its inception. He is credited with developing many of the company's early technologies, including its battery technology and electric drivetrain systems. Straubel also serves as Tesla's Chief Technology Officer (CTO).</p>
<p>Elon Musk is perhaps the most well-known of Tesla's founders. Musk joined the company in 2004 after investing $6.5 million into it. He quickly became CEO of the company and has since been instrumental in its success, leading it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world today.</p>
