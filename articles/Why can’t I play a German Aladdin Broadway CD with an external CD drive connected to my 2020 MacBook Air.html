                        <p class="article-text">If you’ve recently purchased a 2020 MacBook Air and are trying to play a German Aladdin Broadway CD with an external CD drive, you may be wondering why it’s not working. Unfortunately, the answer is that the 2020 MacBook Air does not have an optical drive, which means it cannot read CDs or DVDs.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The 2020 MacBook Air is the first Apple laptop to not include an optical drive. This means that if you want to play a CD or DVD, you’ll need to use an external drive. However, even if you have an external drive, it won’t work with the 2020 MacBook Air. That’s because the 2020 MacBook Air does not have a built-in optical drive, so it cannot read the data on the CD or DVD.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4022121/pexels-photo-4022121.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="wooden-surface-with-knife-marks"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">So why did Apple decide to remove the optical drive from the 2020 MacBook Air? The main reason is that optical drives are becoming increasingly obsolete. With the rise of streaming services and digital downloads, fewer and fewer people are using physical media like CDs and DVDs. As a result, Apple decided to remove the optical drive from the 2020 MacBook Air in order to make the laptop thinner and lighter.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Unfortunately, this means that if you want to play a German Aladdin Broadway CD with an external CD drive, you’ll need to purchase an older model of MacBook Air that still has an optical drive. Alternatively, you could purchase a USB-C external optical drive, which should work with the 2020 MacBook Air.</p><br>
