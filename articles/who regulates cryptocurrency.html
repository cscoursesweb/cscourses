<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. It is a decentralized form of currency, meaning it is not regulated by any government or central bank. This has led many people to ask the question: who regulates cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is complicated and depends on the type of cryptocurrency in question. Generally speaking, there are two types of cryptocurrency: those that are regulated by governments and those that are not.</p>			
<h3> Cryptocurrencies Regulated by Governments</h3>
<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies that are regulated by governments, the answer is simple: governments regulate them. Governments have been quick to recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies and have taken steps to regulate them in order to protect their citizens from fraud and other criminal activities associated with them.</p>
<p>In most countries, cryptocurrencies are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. These laws require exchanges and other businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies to collect personal information from their customers in order to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. Additionally, some countries have imposed taxes on profits made from trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In addition to AML/KYC regulations, some countries have also implemented specific regulations for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). ICOs are a form of crowdfunding used by startups or companies looking for capital in exchange for tokens or coins representing ownership in the company or project. In order for an ICO to be successful, it must comply with all applicable laws and regulations set forth by the country in which it operates.</p>			
<h3> Cryptocurrencies Not Regulated by Governments</h3>
<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies that are not regulated by governments, there is no single entity responsible for regulating them. Instead, these types of cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralized network of computers running software protocols known as consensus algorithms. These algorithms ensure that all transactions on the network are valid and secure without any need for third-party oversight or regulation.</p>
<p>The most popular consensus algorithm used today is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW requires miners (computers running specialized software) to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions on the network and create new blocks of data containing transaction information. This process ensures that all transactions on the network remain secure without any need for third-party oversight or regulation.</p>
<p>Other consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) also exist but they do not require miners like PoW does; instead they rely on users staking their coins as collateral in order to validate transactions on the network. While PoS does not require miners like PoW does, it still relies on users staking their coins as collateral which can be seen as a form of regulation since users must put up their own funds in order for transactions on the network to be validated securely without any need for third-party oversight or regulation.</p>			
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ultimately, who regulates cryptocurrency depends largely on what type of cryptocurrency we’re talking about; those that are regulated by governments will be subject to AML/KYC regulations as well as taxes while those that aren’t regulated will rely solely on consensus algorithms such as PoW or PoS which do not require third-party oversight or regulation but still provide users with a secure way of validating transactions without any need for government intervention.</p>
