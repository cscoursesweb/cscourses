        <p class="article-text">If you’re using Angular 11 and you’ve noticed that your structural directives (ngIf) aren’t working, you’re not alone. Many developers have experienced this issue, and it can be frustrating. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem and get your ngIf directives working again.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4164418/pexels-photo-4164418.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-screen-with-code"><figcaption>picture by Antonio Batinić</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">First, it’s important to understand what ngIf directives are and how they work. NgIf directives are used to conditionally render a portion of the HTML template based on a given condition. For example, you might use an ngIf directive to show or hide a button based on whether a user is logged in or not.</p><br><p class="article-text">If your ngIf directives aren’t working, the first thing you should do is check your code for any typos or errors. Make sure that the condition you’re using is valid and that the syntax is correct. If you’re still having trouble, try using the Angular CLI to generate a new project and see if the ngIf directives work there.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the problem persists, it’s possible that the issue is related to the version of Angular you’re using. Angular 11 introduced a new syntax for ngIf directives, so if you’re using an older version of Angular, the syntax may not be compatible. Try upgrading to the latest version of Angular and see if that resolves the issue.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re still having trouble, it’s possible that the issue is related to the browser you’re using. Different browsers may interpret the ngIf directives differently, so try using a different browser and see if that resolves the issue.</p><br>
