        <p class="article-text">The short answer is yes, Whonix does traffic non-browser requests through Tor. Whonix is a security-focused operating system that is designed to provide users with a secure and anonymous online experience. It is based on the Tor anonymity network and is designed to route all of a user’s internet traffic through the Tor network. This includes both browser requests and non-browser requests.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4050315/pexels-photo-4050315.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="young-lady-typing-on-keyboard-of-laptop-in-living-room"><figcaption>picture by Vlada Karpovich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Whonix is a Debian-based Linux distribution that is designed to be used in conjunction with the Tor anonymity network.

It is designed to route all of a user’s internet traffic through the Tor network, including both browser requests and non-browser requests. This is done by using a combination of virtual machines and the Tor network. The virtual machines are used to isolate the user’s traffic from the rest of the internet, while the Tor network is used to route the traffic through a series of encrypted nodes. This ensures that the user’s traffic is secure and anonymous.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/607812/pexels-photo-607812.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-holding-iphone-showing-social-networks-folder"><figcaption>picture by Tracy Le Blanc</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition to routing all of a user’s internet traffic through the Tor network, Whonix also provides additional security features. These include a firewall, anti-virus protection, and a secure DNS server. These features help to ensure that a user’s traffic is secure and anonymous.</p><br>
