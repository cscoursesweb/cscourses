                        <p class="article-text">If you’re asking yourself whether it’s time to move on from your old and slow laptop, the answer is not so simple. It depends on a few factors, such as the age of your laptop, the type of hardware it has, and the amount of money you’re willing to spend.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">If your laptop is more than five years old, it’s likely that the hardware is outdated and won’t be able to keep up with the latest software and applications. In this case, it’s probably time to move on and invest in a new laptop.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/210600/pexels-photo-210600.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="antique-bills-business-cash"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, if your laptop is relatively new (less than five years old), there are a few things you can do to try and speed it up. The first step is to make sure your laptop is free of viruses and malware. Run a full system scan with an antivirus program to make sure your laptop is clean.</p><br><p class="article-text">Next, you should check to see if your laptop is running out of storage space. If your hard drive is full, it can slow down your laptop significantly. Consider deleting any unnecessary files or programs, or investing in an external hard drive to store your files.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/117729/pexels-photo-117729.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-internal-hdd-on-black-surface"><figcaption>picture by Azamat Esenaliev</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">You can also try to speed up your laptop by disabling any unnecessary startup programs. These programs can take up valuable resources and slow down your laptop’s boot time. To disable startup programs, open the Task Manager and look for the “Startup” tab.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can try to upgrade your laptop’s hardware. If your laptop is relatively new, you may be able to upgrade the RAM or hard drive to improve its performance. However, this can be expensive and may not be worth the cost.</p><br>
