It was introduced in September 2009 and applies to all new cars registered from September 2014 onwards. The main aim of Euro 5 is to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and hydrocarbons (HC). Euro 5 sets limits on the amount of these pollutants that can be emitted from a vehicle, with stricter limits than those set by Euro 4. This">

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Euro 5 is a set of standards for emissions from motor vehicles that was introduced in 2009. It is the fifth iteration of the European Union's emissions standards, and it applies to all new cars sold in the EU. The main aim of Euro 5 is to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).</p>
<p>Euro 5 was introduced as part of the European Commission's strategy to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. The standards are designed to reduce emissions of NOx and PM, which are both pollutants that can have a negative impact on human health and the environment. Euro 5 also sets limits on other pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).</p>

<h3> What Are the Benefits of Euro 5?</h3>
<p>The introduction of Euro 5 has had a number of benefits for both people and the environment. Firstly, it has helped to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles, which can have a negative impact on human health. Studies have shown that exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and COPD. By reducing emissions from motor vehicles, Euro 5 has helped to improve air quality in cities across Europe.</p>
<p>Euro 5 has also had a positive impact on the environment. By reducing emissions from motor vehicles, it has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. It has also helped to reduce acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide emissions, which can damage ecosystems and wildlife habitats.</p>

<h3> How Does Euro 5 Work?</h3>
<p>Euro 5 works by setting limits on how much certain pollutants can be emitted by motor vehicles. These limits are based on laboratory tests that measure how much NOx, PM, CO, HC and SO2 are emitted when a vehicle is running at different speeds and under different conditions. The limits set by Euro 5 are stricter than those set by previous iterations of the European Union's emissions standards.</p>
<p>In order for a vehicle to meet Euro 5 standards it must pass an emission test known as an 'on-board diagnostic' or OBD test. This test measures how much NOx, PM, CO, HC and SO2 are emitted when the vehicle is running at different speeds and under different conditions. If a vehicle fails this test then it cannot be sold in Europe until it meets the required standards.</p>

<h3> When Was Euro 5 Introduced?</h3>
<p>Euro 5 was introduced in 2009 as part of the European Commission's strategy to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. It replaced its predecessor - Euro 4 - which had been in place since 2005 but was deemed insufficient for reducing air pollution levels across Europe. Since its introduction in 2009, all new cars sold in Europe must meet or exceed Euro 5 standards before they can be registered for use on public roads.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing stricter emission limits for new cars sold in Europe, Euro 5 also requires manufacturers to fit their cars with an OBD system so that they can be tested for compliance with emission limits before they are registered for use on public roads. This system helps ensure that all new cars sold in Europe meet or exceed emission limits set out by Euro 5 regulations before they enter service on public roads across Europe.
