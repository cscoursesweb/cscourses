                        <p class="article-text">If you're a Mac user who uses Google Chrome, you may have noticed that the keyboard shortcut for selecting text to the beginning or end of a line (Command + Shift + Left/Right Arrow) isn't working. This can be a frustrating issue, especially if you're used to using this shortcut to quickly select text. Fortunately, there are a few potential solutions that can help you get this shortcut working again.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first thing to try is to make sure that the shortcut is enabled in your Chrome settings. To do this, open Chrome and go to the menu in the top right corner. Select Settings, then go to the Advanced tab. Scroll down to the Keyboard Shortcuts section and make sure that the box next to "Enable global keyboard shortcuts" is checked. If it isn't, check it and then try the shortcut again.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7689676/pexels-photo-7689676.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="braided-woman-typing-on-a-keyboard"><figcaption>picture by Jep Gambardella</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If that doesn't work, you may need to adjust your Mac's system settings. Go to System Preferences, then select Keyboard. Go to the Shortcuts tab and make sure that the box next to "Allow text selection in Quick Look windows" is checked. If it isn't, check it and then try the shortcut again.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the shortcut still isn't working, you may need to adjust your Mac's accessibility settings. Go to System Preferences, then select Accessibility. Go to the Mouse & Trackpad tab and make sure that the box next to "Enable Mouse Keys" is checked. If it isn't, check it and then try the shortcut again.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8815910/pexels-photo-8815910.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-in-black-suit-standing-near-the-while-holding-keys"><figcaption>picture by Kampus Production</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">If none of these solutions work, you may need to try a different browser. Safari and Firefox both support the Command + Shift + Left/Right Arrow shortcut, so you may want to try using one of those browsers instead.</p><br>
