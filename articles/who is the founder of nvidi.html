<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>NVIDIA is one of the most well-known and respected names in the world of computer science and technology. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA has become a leader in the development of graphics processing units (GPUs) and other technologies related to computer graphics, gaming, and artificial intelligence. But who is the founder of NVIDIA?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is Jen-Hsun Huang, also known as JHH. Born in Taiwan in 1963, JHH moved to the United States at age 18 to attend Oregon State University. After graduating with a degree in electrical engineering, he went on to earn his master’s degree from Stanford University. It was during his time at Stanford that JHH developed an interest in computer graphics and began working on what would eventually become NVIDIA’s first product: a 3D graphics processor for personal computers.</p>			
<h3> How Did Jen-Hsun Huang Create NVIDIA?</h3>
<p>JHH had been working on his 3D graphics processor for several years before he decided to found NVIDIA. He had already developed a prototype and was looking for investors when he met Chris Malachowsky, another electrical engineer who shared JHH’s vision for creating a company that could revolutionize computer graphics technology. With Malachowsky’s help, JHH was able to secure funding from venture capitalists and officially launch NVIDIA in 1993.</p>
<p>JHH served as CEO of NVIDIA until 2018 when he stepped down from the role but remained as executive chairman of the board. Under his leadership, NVIDIA grew from a small startup into one of the world’s leading technology companies with over 10,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues exceeding $10 billion USD.</p>

<h3> What Has Jen-Hsun Huang Accomplished With NVIDIA?</h3>
<p>Since its founding, NVIDIA has become one of the most influential companies in computer science and technology thanks largely to JHH’s vision and leadership. Under his guidance, NVIDIA has developed some of the most advanced GPUs on the market which are used by millions of people around the world for gaming, video editing, virtual reality applications, artificial intelligence research, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to developing powerful GPUs for consumers, JHH also led NVIDIA into new markets such as self-driving cars where its GPUs are used by automakers like Tesla to power their autonomous vehicles. He also spearheaded initiatives such as Project Denver which aimed to create powerful processors specifically designed for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.</p>			
<h3> What Does The Future Hold For Jen-Hsun Huang And NVIDIA?</h3>
<p>JHH remains involved with NVIDIA as executive chairman but has stepped away from day-to-day operations so that he can focus on philanthropic endeavors such as supporting education initiatives in Taiwan where he grew up. As for what lies ahead for him personally or professionally remains unclear but it is certain that his legacy will continue to live on through his work at NVIDIA which continues to innovate and push boundaries within computer science and technology today.</p>
