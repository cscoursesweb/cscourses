                        <p class="article-text">Cryptanalysis is the practice of breaking cryptographic algorithms and systems to gain access to encrypted data. It is a powerful tool used by hackers and security professionals alike to gain access to sensitive information. In this article, we will discuss the best known cryptanalytic attacks against AES-128 with 9 rounds.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">AES-128 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 128-bit key to encrypt data. It is one of the most widely used encryption algorithms and is considered to be very secure. However, it is not immune to cryptanalytic attacks.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1842/nature-photography-analog-camera-canon.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="nature-photography-analog-camera-canon"><figcaption>picture by Little Visuals</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The most well-known cryptanalytic attack against AES-128 with 9 rounds is the biclique attack. This attack was first proposed by researchers in 2001 and is based on the concept of a biclique. A biclique is a set of two subsets of a graph, such that each subset is connected to every other element in the other subset. In the context of AES-128, the biclique attack works by finding two subsets of the key schedule that are related in a certain way. By exploiting this relationship, the attacker can reduce the number of rounds required to break the encryption.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another well-known cryptanalytic attack against AES-128 with 9 rounds is the related-key attack. This attack was first proposed by researchers in 2002 and is based on the concept of related keys. Related keys are two keys that are related in a certain way, such that the encryption of one key can be used to decrypt the other. In the context of AES-128, the related-key attack works by finding two related keys that can be used to reduce the number of rounds required to break the encryption.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11048540/pexels-photo-11048540.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-and-silver-canon-ae-1-camera"><figcaption>picture by Sarah Blocksidge</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the most recent cryptanalytic attack against AES-128 with 9 rounds is the boomerang attack. This attack was first proposed by researchers in 2008 and is based on the concept of a boomerang. A boomerang is a set of two related keys that can be used to reduce the number of rounds required to break the encryption. In the context of AES-128, the boomerang attack works by finding two related keys that can be used to reduce the number of rounds required to break the encryption.</p><br>
