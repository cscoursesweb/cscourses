                <meta name="description" content="This article will explore the advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning models on examples versus using prompting with the context of the task for specific tasks. We will discuss the various factors to consider when deciding which approach is best for a given task, such as the complexity of the task, the availability of data, and the desired accuracy of the model. We will also provide examples of when each approach is most effective. Finally, we will provide a conclusion on which approach is best for specific tasks.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to specific tasks, it can be difficult to decide whether it is better to fine-tune models on examples or just use prompting with the context of the task. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on the specific task at hand.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Fine-tuning models on examples is a process of adjusting a pre-trained model to better fit a specific task. This approach is useful when the task is similar to the task the model was originally trained on, as the model can be quickly adapted to the new task. This approach is also useful when the task requires a large amount of data, as the model can be trained on the existing data rather than having to collect new data. However, this approach can be time-consuming and expensive, as it requires a lot of computing power and resources.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/13355198/pexels-photo-13355198.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-green-long-sleeve-shirt-and-blue-denim-jeans"><figcaption>picture by Ajay Gill</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Using prompting with the context of the task is a process of providing the model with information about the task in order to help it better understand the task. This approach is useful when the task is not similar to the task the model was originally trained on, as the model can be quickly adapted to the new task without having to collect new data. This approach is also useful when the task requires a small amount of data, as the model can be trained on the existing data rather than having to collect new data. However, this approach can be difficult to implement, as it requires a lot of manual effort to provide the model with the necessary information.</p><br>
