                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide an overview of two Android System apps that have been flagged as false positives by AVG/Avast. We will discuss what a false positive is, why it may have occurred, and how to determine if the apps are safe to use. We will also provide tips on how to prevent false positives in the future. Finally, we will discuss the implications of false positives and how to address them.">

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to this question is yes, it is normal for AVG/Avast to flag two Android system apps as false positives. False positives occur when a security program incorrectly identifies a legitimate file or program as malicious. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including the security program not recognizing the file or program, or the file or program being too new for the security program to recognize.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When it comes to Android system apps, false positives are especially common. This is because Android system apps are constantly being updated and changed, and security programs may not recognize the new versions. Additionally, Android system apps often contain code that is similar to malicious code, which can also lead to false positives.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3803517/pexels-photo-3803517.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="web-banner-with-online-information-on-computer"><figcaption>picture by Brett Sayles</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Fortunately, false positives are usually easy to identify and resolve. If AVG/Avast flags two Android system apps as false positives, the first step is to check the details of the alert. This will usually provide information about the file or program that was flagged, as well as the reason for the alert. If the alert is indeed a false positive, the user can then choose to ignore it or whitelist the file or program.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that false positives can be a sign of a more serious issue, such as a virus or malware infection. If AVG/Avast flags multiple files or programs as false positives, it is a good idea to run a full system scan to make sure that the system is not infected.</p><br>
