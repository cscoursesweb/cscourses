<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Algorithmic trading is a form of automated trading that uses computer algorithms to determine when and how to trade financial instruments. It is a type of high-frequency trading, which is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities. Algorithmic trading has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to execute trades quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers algorithmic trading services. It allows users to trade digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more. Kraken also provides access to advanced trading tools such as margin trading, futures contracts, and options. In this article, we will discuss what algorithmic trading is and how it works on the Kraken platform.</p>			
<h3>What Is Algorithmic Trading?</h3>
<p>Algorithmic trading is a form of automated trading that uses computer algorithms to determine when and how to trade financial instruments. It is a type of high-frequency trading, which is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities. Algorithmic traders use complex mathematical models and formulas to identify profitable opportunities in the markets. These models are programmed into computers which then execute trades automatically based on the parameters set by the trader.</p>
<p>Algorithmic traders can take advantage of market inefficiencies by executing trades faster than human traders can react. This allows them to capitalize on price discrepancies before they disappear or become too small for manual traders to take advantage of them. Additionally, algorithmic traders can backtest their strategies against historical data before deploying them in live markets. This helps them identify potential risks associated with their strategies before they start using them in real-time markets.</p>			
<h3>How Does Algorithmic Trading Work on Kraken?</h3>
<p>Kraken offers algorithmic trading services for its users through its API (Application Programming Interface). The API allows users to access advanced features such as margin trading, futures contracts, options, and more. Users can also create their own custom algorithms using the API or use pre-built algorithms provided by third-party developers on the platform’s marketplace.</p>
<p>Once an algorithm has been created or selected, it can be deployed in live markets using Kraken’s web interface or mobile app. The algorithm will then automatically execute trades based on the parameters set by the user such as entry/exit points, stop losses/take profits levels etc.. Users can also monitor their positions in real-time using Kraken’s dashboard or mobile app so they can make adjustments if needed while their algorithm is running in live markets.</p>

<p>• Flexibility: Users have access to advanced features such as margin trading, futures contracts, options etc.; this gives users more flexibility when creating their strategies;</p>
<p>• Cost Savings: Automated systems require less time and effort compared with manual systems so users save money by not having to hire additional personnel for managing their portfolios;</p>
<p>• Risk Management: Automated systems allow users to set stop losses/take profits levels so they can limit their risk exposure while still taking advantage of market opportunities;</p>
<p>• Transparency: All transactions are recorded on blockchain technology so users have full transparency over all transactions executed by their algorithms;</p>
<p>• Security: All user data is encrypted so it remains secure at all times; additionally all funds are held in cold storage wallets which adds an extra layer of security against hackers and other malicious actors;</p>
<p>• Support: Kraken provides 24/7 customer support via email or chat so users have access help whenever they need it;</p>
