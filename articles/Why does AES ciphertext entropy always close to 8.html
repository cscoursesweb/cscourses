                <title>Why does AES ciphertext entropy always close to 8?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="AES ciphertext entropy is a measure of the randomness of the ciphertext produced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This measure is important for ensuring the security of the encrypted data. The entropy of AES ciphertext is always close to 8 because the algorithm uses a 128-bit key, which is the maximum key size for the AES algorithm. This means that the ciphertext produced by the algorithm is highly random and unpredictable, making it difficult for attackers to break the encryption. Additionally, the AES algorithm uses a block cipher, which means that the same plaintext will always produce the same ciphertext, further increasing the security of the encrypted data.">

                        <p class="article-text">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that is used to protect sensitive data. It is a block cipher, meaning that it takes a fixed-length block of plaintext as input and produces a fixed-length block of ciphertext as output. AES is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available today.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">One of the key features of AES is its high level of entropy. Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a ciphertext, and it is an important factor in determining the security of an encryption algorithm. The higher the entropy, the more difficult it is for an attacker to guess the plaintext from the ciphertext.</p><br><p class="article-text">The entropy of AES ciphertext is always close to 8. This is because AES is a block cipher, and it operates on a fixed-length block of plaintext. This means that the ciphertext will always have the same length, regardless of the length of the plaintext. As a result, the entropy of the ciphertext will always be close to 8.</p><br><p class="article-text">The reason why AES has such a high level of entropy is because it uses a complex set of mathematical operations to encrypt the plaintext. These operations are designed to make it difficult for an attacker to guess the plaintext from the ciphertext. The complexity of these operations also ensures that the ciphertext is highly random, which helps to increase the entropy of the ciphertext.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4761377/pexels-photo-4761377.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-woman-holding-a-canon-a-e1"><figcaption>picture by Engin Akyurt</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition to its high level of entropy, AES also has a number of other security features that make it a secure encryption algorithm. These include its use of a key schedule, which helps to ensure that the same key is not used to encrypt multiple blocks of plaintext. It also uses a variety of different modes of operation, which help to make it more resistant to certain types of attacks.</p><br>
