<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a popular investment vehicle for many investors. They offer a low-cost way to diversify your portfolio and gain exposure to a wide range of asset classes. But how many ETFs are there? In this blog post, we'll explore the answer to this question and discuss the different types of ETFs available.</p>			
<h3>What is an Exchange Traded Fund?</h3>
<p>An exchange traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund that is traded on a stock exchange. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a basket of securities, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange and can be bought and sold throughout the day.</p>
<p>ETFs offer investors several advantages over traditional investments. For example, they provide instant diversification across multiple asset classes with just one purchase. Additionally, ETFs typically have lower fees than mutual funds and can be bought and sold quickly and easily on the stock exchange.</p>

<h3>Types of Exchange Traded Funds</h3>
<p>There are several different types of ETFs available for investors to choose from. The most common type is equity ETFs which track a particular index or sector such as the S&P 500 or technology sector. Other types of ETFs include bond ETFs which track fixed income securities such as government bonds; commodity ETFs which track commodities such as gold or oil; currency ETFs which track foreign currencies; and inverse/leveraged ETFs which use derivatives to amplify returns in either direction (positive or negative).</p>

<h3>How Many Exchange Traded Funds Are There?</h3>
<p>As of April 2021, there were more than 7,000 exchange traded funds listed on U.S exchanges alone according to data from Morningstar Direct. This number includes both domestic and international equity funds as well as bond funds, commodity funds, currency funds, inverse/leveraged funds, and other specialty products such as actively managed funds and smart beta strategies. The total number of global exchange traded products is even higher when you include those listed on exchanges outside the U.S., bringing the total number closer to 10,000 worldwide.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exchange traded funds offer investors a low-cost way to diversify their portfolios across multiple asset classes with just one purchase. There are currently more than 7,000 exchange traded products listed on U.S exchanges alone with thousands more listed globally across various exchanges around the world. With so many options available it can be difficult for investors to decide which ones are right for them but understanding the different types of ETFs available can help make this decision easier.I highly recommend exploring these related articles, which will provide valuable insights and help you gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.:<a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/how%20exchange-traded%20funds%20are%20priced.html'>www.cscourses.dev/how-exchange-traded-funds-are-priced.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/exchange-traded%20funds%20examples.html'>www.cscourses.dev/exchange-traded-funds-examples.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/are%20exchange%20traded%20funds%20safe.html'>www.cscourses.dev/are-exchange-traded-funds-safe.html</a></p>
