                <meta name="description" content="The LabelMe annotation format is a popular labeling format for object detection tasks that allows for negative bounding box (Bbox) values. Negative Bbox values are used to indicate that an object is not present in the image, and can be used to improve the accuracy of object detection models. This article will discuss the LabelMe annotation format, how it uses negative Bbox values, and the advantages of using this format for object detection tasks.">

                        <p class="article-text">Labeling formats that have negative Bbox values in labels are typically used for object detection tasks. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects in an image or video. It is a key component of many computer vision applications, such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and medical imaging.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most common labeling format that has negative Bbox values in labels is the Pascal VOC format. This format was developed by the Visual Object Classes (VOC) project, which was a joint effort between the University of Oxford, the University of Evergreen, and the University of Michigan. The Pascal VOC format is a standard for annotating object detection datasets. It is widely used in the computer vision community and is supported by many popular deep learning frameworks.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14925772/pexels-photo-14925772.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-compass-on-a-person-s-hand"><figcaption>picture by A.J. Garces</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The Pascal VOC format uses a bounding box to define the location of an object in an image. The bounding box is defined by four values: the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the box, and the width and height of the box. The x and y coordinates can be either positive or negative, and the width and height can also be negative. This allows the bounding box to extend beyond the boundaries of the image, which is useful for object detection tasks.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Other labeling formats that have negative Bbox values in labels include the YOLO format and the COCO format. The YOLO format was developed by the You Only Look Once (YOLO) project, which is a real-time object detection system. The COCO format was developed by the Common Objects in Context (COCO) project, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. Both of these formats use bounding boxes with negative values to define the location of objects in an image.</p><br>
