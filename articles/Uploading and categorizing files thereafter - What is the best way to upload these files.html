                        <p class="article-text">Uploading and categorizing files thereafter can be a daunting task, especially if you have a large number of files to manage. Fortunately, there are a few best practices that can help make the process easier and more efficient.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in uploading and categorizing files is to create a folder structure that will make it easy to find and organize the files. This can be done by creating a folder for each category of files, such as documents, images, videos, etc. Once the folders are created, you can then upload the files into the appropriate folders.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5668765/pexels-photo-5668765.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-unrecognizable-office-worker-standing-with-papers-in-hand"><figcaption>picture by Sora Shimazaki</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When uploading files, it is important to use a reliable file transfer protocol (FTP) to ensure that the files are transferred securely and quickly. Additionally, it is important to use a file naming convention that will make it easy to identify the files. For example, you may want to use a date-based naming convention, such as “YYYYMMDD_filename.ext”. This will make it easier to find the files later on.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the files are uploaded, it is important to categorize them. This can be done by creating tags or labels for each file. This will make it easier to find the files later on. Additionally, it is important to create a backup of the files in case something happens to the original files.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to keep the files organized. This can be done by creating a system for archiving and deleting old files. Additionally, it is important to regularly check the files to make sure that they are up-to-date and that they are still relevant.</p><br>
