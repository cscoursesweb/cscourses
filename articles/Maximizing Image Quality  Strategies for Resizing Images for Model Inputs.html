                        <p class="article-text">When dealing with images of different sizes that need to be passed to a model of fixed input size, it is important to ensure that details and spatial information are not lost in the process. This can be a tricky task, as it requires careful manipulation of the images to ensure that they are properly resized and scaled without losing any of the important information. Fortunately, there are a few techniques that can be used to help ensure that images of different sizes are properly resized and scaled without losing any of the important details and spatial information.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first technique is to use image interpolation. Image interpolation is a process of resizing an image by adding or removing pixels. This is done by using algorithms to determine the color of the new pixels that are added or removed. This technique is useful for resizing images of different sizes, as it can help to preserve the details and spatial information of the original image.</p><br><p class="article-text">The second technique is to use image scaling. Image scaling is a process of resizing an image by changing the size of the pixels. This is done by using algorithms to determine the size of the new pixels. This technique is useful for resizing images of different sizes, as it can help to preserve the details and spatial information of the original image.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third technique is to use image cropping. Image cropping is a process of resizing an image by removing parts of the image. This is done by using algorithms to determine which parts of the image should be removed. This technique is useful for resizing images of different sizes, as it can help to preserve the details and spatial information of the original image.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3313333/pexels-photo-3313333.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-chain-link-fence-during-dawn"><figcaption>picture by javier gonzalez</figcaption></figure>
