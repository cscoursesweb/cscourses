It is designed to be easy to use and understand, even for those with no prior programming experience. Scratch programming is based on the idea of “blocks”, which are pieces of code that can be dragged and dropped into place to create a program.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3861958/pexels-photo-3861958.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-coding-on-computer"><figcaption>picture by ThisIsEngineering</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">How to Get Started with Scratch Programming on Mobile</p><br><p class="article-text">The first step to getting started with Scratch programming on your mobile device is to download the Scratch app. The Scratch app is available for both iOS and Android devices. Once you have downloaded the app, you can begin creating your own projects.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/38544/imac-apple-mockup-app-38544.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="apple-office-internet-ipad"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When you open the Scratch app, you will be presented with a blank canvas. This is where you will create your project. You can start by dragging and dropping blocks from the “Blocks” menu onto the canvas. These blocks are the building blocks of your program. You can then connect the blocks together to create a program.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have created your program, you can test it by pressing the “Run” button. This will run your program and you can see the results. If you are happy with the results, you can save your project and share it with others.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5792837/pexels-photo-5792837.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-surfer-running-to-ocean-with-surfboard-in-daytime"><figcaption>picture by Laker</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Tips and Tricks for Mobile Scratch Programming</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have the basics of Scratch programming down, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of your mobile Scratch experience.</p><br><p class="article-text">First, it is important to remember that Scratch programming is a visual language. This means that it is important to think about how your program looks as well as how it works. You can use the “Blocks” menu to customize the look of your program.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, it is important to take advantage of the “Help” menu. This menu contains tutorials and other resources that can help you learn more about Scratch programming.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/13826751/pexels-photo-13826751.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-camera-zoom-lens"><figcaption>picture by Looking For Feferences</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to remember that Scratch programming is a collaborative activity. You can share your projects with others and get feedback on your work. This can help you improve your programming skills and create better projects.</p><br>
