        <p class="article-text">When working with web applications, it is often necessary to make changes to the content of a page or image. This is typically done using a patch request, which is a type of HTTP request that allows for the modification of existing resources. However, if the content of the resource has not changed, it is not necessary to send a patch request. Instead, the same image can be returned in the patch request if it is unchanged. In this article, we will discuss how to return the same image in a patch request if unchanged in Express.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5938595/pexels-photo-5938595.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-in-bathrobe-applying-cream-on-leg"><figcaption>picture by Sora Shimazaki</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first step in returning the same image in a patch request if unchanged in Express is to create a route that will handle the patch request. This route should be set up to accept the patch request and then check to see if the image has been modified. If the image has not been modified, the same image should be returned in the patch request.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is to create a function that will check to see if the image has been modified. This function should take the image as an argument and then compare it to the original image. If the images are the same, the function should return true. If the images are different, the function should return false.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6149022/pexels-photo-6149022.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-shot-of-a-sonogram"><figcaption>picture by RODNAE Productions</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the function has been created, it should be added to the route that handles the patch request. This function should be called when the patch request is received and the result should be used to determine whether or not the same image should be returned in the patch request.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the function returns true, the same image should be returned in the patch request. This can be done by using the Express response object to send the image back to the client. The response object should be set up to send the image as an attachment, which will ensure that the image is not modified in transit.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">If the function returns false, the patch request should be processed as normal. This means that the image should be modified according to the instructions in the patch request and then sent back to the client.</p><br>
