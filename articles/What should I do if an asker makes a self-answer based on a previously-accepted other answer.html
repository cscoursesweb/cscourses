                <meta name="description" content="If an asker makes a self-answer based on a previously-accepted other answer, it is important to evaluate the self-answer to ensure that it is an accurate and complete answer to the question. If the self-answer is accurate and complete, it should be accepted as the answer to the question. If the self-answer is incomplete or inaccurate, the asker should be encouraged to revise the answer or provide additional information to make it more accurate and complete. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the asker has properly credited the original answer in their self-answer.">

                        <p class="article-text">If you come across an asker who has made a self-answer based on a previously-accepted answer, there are a few things you can do.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you should take a look at the self-answer and compare it to the previously-accepted answer. If the self-answer is a direct copy of the previously-accepted answer, then you should flag the self-answer as plagiarism. If the self-answer is a modified version of the previously-accepted answer, then you should consider whether the self-answer adds any new information or insights that werenâ€™t present in the previously-accepted answer. If the self-answer does not add any new information or insights, then you should flag the self-answer as plagiarism.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6776717/pexels-photo-6776717.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-holding-a-child-that-is-holding-a-fruit"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If the self-answer does add new information or insights, then you should consider whether the self-answer is a valid answer to the question. If the self-answer is a valid answer to the question, then you should leave it as is. If the self-answer is not a valid answer to the question, then you should flag the self-answer as not an answer.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to flagging the self-answer, you should also consider leaving a comment on the self-answer. If the self-answer is a direct copy of the previously-accepted answer, then you should leave a comment informing the asker that their self-answer is a direct copy of the previously-accepted answer and that it should be removed. If the self-answer is a modified version of the previously-accepted answer, then you should leave a comment informing the asker that their self-answer should be modified to add new information or insights that werenâ€™t present in the previously-accepted answer.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12243529/pexels-photo-12243529.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-carrying-a-sack-on-his-head"><figcaption>picture by Adil AhnafðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you should consider leaving a comment on the previously-accepted answer. If the self-answer is a direct copy of the previously-accepted answer, then you should leave a comment informing the asker that their self-answer is a direct copy of the previously-accepted answer and that it should be removed. If the self-answer is a modified version of the previously-accepted answer, then you should leave a comment informing the asker that their self-answer should be modified to add new information or insights that werenâ€™t present in the previously-accepted answer.</p><br>
