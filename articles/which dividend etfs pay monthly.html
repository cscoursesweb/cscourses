<h3>What Are Monthly Dividend ETFs?</h3>
<p>Monthly dividend ETFs are exchange-traded funds that pay out dividends on a monthly basis rather than quarterly or annually like other types of dividend-paying investments. These funds typically invest in stocks or bonds that pay out regular dividends each month. By investing in these types of funds, investors can receive a steady stream of income without having to wait for quarterly or annual payments from other investments such as stocks and mutual funds.</p>
<p>Monthly dividend ETFs can be used as part of an overall investment strategy and can provide investors with additional income on top of their regular salary or other investments such as stocks and bonds.

This helps reduce risk by spreading out investments across multiple asset classes and sectors which can help protect against market volatility.</p>
<p>- Low Fees: Many monthly dividend ETFs have low fees compared to other types of investments such as mutual funds which makes them more cost effective for investors who want access to a wide range of assets without paying high fees associated with actively managed funds.</p>
