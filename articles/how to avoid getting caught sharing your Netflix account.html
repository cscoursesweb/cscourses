                <h6>Limit the number of people you share your account with</h6>
                <p class="article-text">Limiting the number of people you share your Netflix account with is one of the most important steps in avoiding detection. The more people you share your account with, the greater the chance that one of them will use it in a way that will raise a red flag for Netflix. This could be something as simple as watching shows or movies that they wouldn’t normally watch, or accessing the account from a location that is different from your own.</p>
                <p class="article-text">When you share your account with too many people, it becomes more difficult to keep track of who is using it and when. This increases the likelihood that one of the people you’ve shared your account with will use it in a way that is against Netflix’s terms of service. Additionally, the more people you share your account with, the more likely it is that someone will share the account with someone else, which further increases the chances of getting caught.</p>
                <p class="article-text">By limiting the number of people you share your account with, you can reduce the risk of getting caught and ensure that your account remains in good standing with Netflix. So, be selective about who you share your account with, and make sure that everyone you share your account with understands the account sharing policy and will use it responsibly.</p>
                
                <h6>Use a VPN</h6>
                <p class="article-text">A virtual private network (VPN) is a powerful tool that can help you avoid getting caught sharing your Netflix account. A VPN allows you to access Netflix from a different location, making it more difficult for Netflix to detect that multiple users are accessing the account from the same IP address.</p>
                <figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/720/0*brMuWAf2Lr0Mz2Zb" class="article-image" alt="laptop opened with vpn interface on it"><figcaption>photo by Kevin Paster</figcaption></figure>
                <p class="article-text">By connecting to a VPN, you can change your IP address to one that is located in a different country or region. This makes it more difficult for Netflix to detect that multiple users are accessing the account from the same location, as the IP addresses will appear to be coming from different locations. This can be very useful if you are sharing your account with someone who lives in a different country or region from you.</p>
                <p class="article-text">One example of VPN that can be used is NordVPN. NordVPN is a popular VPN service that offers a wide range of features. This can be useful if you want to access Netflix from a different country or region.</p>
                <p class="article-text">It’s important to keep in mind that using a VPN may not completely solve the problem of account sharing, as Netflix is always working to detect and prevent account sharing. However, using a VPN can make it more difficult for Netflix to detect that multiple users are accessing the account from the same IP address, which can help reduce the chances of getting caught.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Keep in mind that not all VPNs work with Netflix, and some may not be able to bypass the VPN detection systems Netflix uses. So, it’s important to research and choose a reputable VPN service that is known to work with Netflix.</p>
                
                <h6>Use a unique profile for each person you share your account with</h6>
                <p class="article-text">Using a unique profile for each person you share your Netflix account with is an effective way to reduce the chances of getting caught. When each person has their own profile, it makes it more difficult for Netflix to prove that they are all sharing the same account. This is because each profile will have its own viewing history, watch list, and other personalized information.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Creating unique profiles is easy to do. All you need to do is go to the “Manage Profiles” section of your Netflix account, and add a new profile for each person you want to share your account with. Once you’ve created the profiles, you can then share the login information with the people you want to share your account with, and they can log in to their own profile.</p>

                <p class="article-text">When each person uses their own profile, it makes it more difficult for Netflix to detect that multiple people are accessing the account. This is because each profile will have its own viewing history, watch list, and other personalized information. Additionally, if Netflix does detect multiple users accessing the account, it will be more difficult for them to prove that all of the users are sharing the same account, as each user will have their own profile and viewing history.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Another benefit of using unique profiles is that it allows each user to have their own personalized experience, as each profile will have its own watch list, viewing history, and other information. This can be especially helpful for families or groups of friends who want to share an account but also want to have their own personalized experience.</p>
                <p class="article-text">It’s important to keep in mind that using unique profiles is not a guarantee that you will never get caught sharing your Netflix account. Netflix is constantly working to detect and prevent account sharing, and using unique profiles may not completely solve the problem. However, using unique profiles can make it more difficult for Netflix to detect that multiple people are sharing the same account, which can help reduce the chances of getting caught.</p>
    
                <h6>Make sure everyone you share your account with knows the account sharing policy</h6>
                <p class="article-text">Making sure that everyone you share your Netflix account with understands the account sharing policy is crucial to avoiding detection. It’s important to ensure that everyone you share your account with knows that they should not share the account with anyone else, and that they should not use it to watch shows or movies that they would not normally watch.</p>
                <p class="article-text">When people understand the account sharing policy, they are less likely to use the account in a way that will raise a red flag for Netflix. For example, if they know that they should not share the account with anyone else, they are less likely to give out the login information to someone else. Additionally, if they know that they should not use the account to watch shows or movies that they would not normally watch, they are less likely to do so, which can help reduce the chances of getting caught.</p>

                <p class="article-text">By following these tips, you can reduce your risk of getting caught sharing your Netflix account. However, it’s important to remember that Netflix does not condone account sharing and may take action to prevent it. So make sure to monitor your account usage, and don’t share your account with anyone you don’t trust.</p>
