<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When it comes to electric cars, Tesla is one of the most popular and well-known brands. With a range of models available, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. One of the key factors in making this decision is size – so which Tesla model is the biggest?</p>

<h3>Tesla Model X</h3>
<p>The Tesla Model X is the largest car in the range. It has a length of 198.3 inches, a width of 78.9 inches and a height of 66.3 inches. It also has a wheelbase of 116.7 inches, giving it plenty of interior space for passengers and cargo alike. The Model X also has an impressive range of up to 325 miles on a single charge, making it ideal for long-distance trips.</p>			
<h3>Tesla Model S</h3>
<p>The Tesla Model S is slightly smaller than the Model X, but still offers plenty of space for passengers and cargo alike. It has a length of 196 inches, a width of 77.3 inches and a height of 56 inches – making it slightly shorter than the Model X but still offering plenty of interior space. The Model S also has an impressive range of up to 373 miles on a single charge, making it ideal for long-distance trips as well as everyday use around town.</p>			
<h3>Tesla Model 3</h3>
<p>The Tesla Model 3 is the smallest car in the range, but still offers plenty of interior space for passengers and cargo alike. It has a length of 184 inches, a width of 72 inches and a height of 56 inches – making it significantly shorter than both the Model S and X but still offering plenty of interior space for passengers and cargo alike. The Model 3 also has an impressive range of up to 310 miles on a single charge, making it ideal for everyday use around town as well as longer trips when needed.</p>			
<h3>Tesla Roadster</h3>
<p>The Tesla Roadster is not only the smallest car in the range but also one with the shortest range – just 200 miles on a single charge – so it’s not ideal for long-distance trips or everyday use around town unless you’re willing to recharge often! However, despite its small size (it has a length just 162 inches) it still offers plenty interior space for passengers and cargo alike thanks to its width (77 inches) and height (44 inches).</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you’re looking for an electric car with plenty interior space then your best bet would be either the Tesla Model X or S – both offer plenty room inside while also having impressive ranges that make them suitable for long-distance trips as well as everyday use around town. If you’re looking for something smaller then you could opt for either the Tesla Model 3 or Roadster – both offer plenty room inside while having shorter ranges that make them more suitable for everyday use around town rather than long-distance trips unless you’re willing to recharge often!</p>
