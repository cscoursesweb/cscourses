<h3>The History of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to create an electric car that was both efficient and reliable. The company was initially funded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who remains its CEO today. Since then, Tesla has grown into one of the most recognizable names in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>In 2008, Tesla released its first car: the Roadster. This two-seater sports car was powered entirely by electricity and had a range of over 200 miles per charge. It quickly became popular with early adopters and helped put Tesla on the map as an innovator in electric vehicle technology.</p>
<p>Since then, Tesla has released several other models including the Model S sedan, Model X SUV, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV. All of these cars are powered entirely by electricity and have ranges up to 300 miles per charge depending on model and battery size.</p>

<h3>Tesla's Innovative Technology</h3>
<p>Tesla's vehicles are not only powered entirely by electricity but also feature some of the most advanced technology available today. For example, all models come standard with Autopilot – an advanced driver assistance system that can handle some driving tasks such as lane keeping and adaptive cruise control – as well as Full Self-Driving Capability which allows for fully autonomous driving when enabled through software updates over-the-air (OTA).</p>
<p>In addition to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability, all Tesla vehicles come standard with a large touchscreen display that serves as both an infotainment system and digital instrument cluster for controlling various vehicle functions such as climate control or navigation settings. This display also provides access to other features such as streaming music services or web browsing capabilities via built-in LTE connectivity (available on select models).</p>

<h3>Tesla's Impact on Sustainable Energy</h3>
<p>In addition to producing some of the most advanced electric cars available today, Tesla is also working hard to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels through their energy storage solutions and solar products such as Solar Roof tiles or Powerwall home batteries which allow homeowners to store excess solar energy for later use or even sell it back to their local utility provider at times when demand is high (known as “demand response”).</p>
<p>By providing these innovative solutions for sustainable energy production and storage, Tesla is helping us move closer towards a future where we rely less on fossil fuels for our energy needs – something that will benefit us all in the long run!</p>
