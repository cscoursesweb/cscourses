                <title>How to proof Two CipherTexts holding same value with Zero Knowledge Proof?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide an overview of how to use Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to prove that two ciphertexts hold the same value. We will discuss the concept of ZKP, the steps involved in the process, and the advantages of using this method. We will also provide examples of how to use ZKP to prove that two ciphertexts hold the same value. Finally, we will discuss the security implications of using ZKP to prove the equality of two ciphertexts. By the end of this article, you should have a better understanding of how to use ZKP to prove that two ciphertexts hold the same value.">

                        <p class="article-text">Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a certain value without revealing the value itself. This is useful in situations where one party needs to prove that they know something without revealing the actual information. In this article, we will discuss how to use Zero Knowledge Proof to prove that two ciphertexts hold the same value.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in proving that two ciphertexts hold the same value is to generate a random number. This random number is known as the challenge. The challenge is used to ensure that the two ciphertexts are indeed the same. The challenge is then sent to both parties.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is for each party to generate a response to the challenge. The response is generated by encrypting the challenge with the ciphertext. This response is then sent back to the other party.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third step is for the two parties to compare their responses. If the responses are the same, then it can be assumed that the two ciphertexts hold the same value. If the responses are different, then it can be assumed that the two ciphertexts do not hold the same value.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/760728/pexels-photo-760728.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="motivational-quotes"><figcaption>picture by Bich Tran</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The fourth step is for the two parties to generate a zero-knowledge proof. This proof is generated by encrypting the challenge with the ciphertexts. The proof is then sent to the other party.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The fifth step is for the two parties to compare the zero-knowledge proof. If the proof is the same, then it can be assumed that the two ciphertexts hold the same value. If the proof is different, then it can be assumed that the two ciphertexts do not hold the same value.</p><br>
