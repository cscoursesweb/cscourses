                <meta name="description" content="Embeddings Array is an important component of BERT's feature extraction process. It is a set of vectors that represent the words in a sentence or document. Each vector contains information about the word's meaning, context, and relationship to other words in the sentence. Embeddings Array helps BERT to understand the context of a sentence and extract meaningful features from it. This helps BERT to better understand the text and provide more accurate results.">

                        <p class="article-text">Embeddings array is an important part of BERT’s feature extraction process. BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a deep learning model developed by Google for natural language processing (NLP). It is used to create contextualized representations of words, sentences, and documents.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The embeddings array is a representation of the words in a sentence or document. It is a vector of numbers that represent the words in the sentence or document. Each word is represented by a vector of numbers, which is called an embedding. The embeddings array is a collection of all the embeddings for each word in the sentence or document.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7285931/pexels-photo-7285931.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-embedded-nail-on-a-wood-block"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The embeddings array is used by BERT to create a contextualized representation of the words in the sentence or document. BERT uses the embeddings array to create a representation of the words in the sentence or document that takes into account the context of the words. This means that the representation of the words in the sentence or document is based on the words that come before and after them.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">For example, if the sentence is “The cat is sleeping”, the embeddings array would represent the words “the”, “cat”, “is”, and “sleeping”. The embeddings array would take into account the context of the words, so that the representation of “cat” would be different from the representation of “sleeping”.</p><br>
