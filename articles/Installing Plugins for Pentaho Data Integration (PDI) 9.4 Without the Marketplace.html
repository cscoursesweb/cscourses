                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) 9.4 Marketplace is missing, and many users are wondering how to install plugins now. Fortunately, there are still several ways to install plugins in PDI 9.4. In this article, we will discuss the different methods of installing plugins in PDI 9.4.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first method of installing plugins in PDI 9.4 is to use the Pentaho Marketplace. The Pentaho Marketplace is a web-based application that allows users to browse and install plugins for their PDI installation. The Marketplace is available for both the Community and Enterprise editions of PDI. To access the Marketplace, simply log in to your PDI instance and click on the Marketplace icon in the top right corner of the screen. From there, you can browse the available plugins and install them with a few clicks.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12519413/pexels-photo-12519413.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="back-of-a-woman-walking-by-market-stalls-with-a-bag"><figcaption>picture by Mathias Reding</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second method of installing plugins in PDI 9.4 is to use the Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) Plugin Manager. The Plugin Manager is a desktop application that allows users to browse and install plugins for their PDI installation. To access the Plugin Manager, simply open the PDI application and click on the “Tools” menu. From there, select the “Plugin Manager” option. The Plugin Manager will then open, allowing you to browse the available plugins and install them with a few clicks.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The third method of installing plugins in PDI 9.4 is to manually install them. This method requires a bit more technical knowledge, but it is still possible. To manually install a plugin, you will need to download the plugin’s .zip file from the plugin’s website. Once you have the .zip file, you will need to extract it and copy the plugin’s .jar file to the “plugins” folder in your PDI installation directory. Once the .jar file is in the “plugins” folder, you will need to restart PDI for the plugin to be recognized.</p><br>
