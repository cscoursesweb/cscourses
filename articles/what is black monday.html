<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Black Monday is a term used to describe the stock market crash of October 19, 1987. On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 22.6%, the largest one-day percentage drop in its history. The crash was caused by a combination of factors, including overvaluation of stocks, high levels of debt, and computerized trading systems that exacerbated the sell-off. The crash had a significant impact on global markets and economies, leading to a recession in many countries.</p>
<h3>What Caused Black Monday?</h3>
<p>The primary cause of Black Monday was overvaluation of stocks. In the years leading up to the crash, stock prices had been rising steadily due to strong economic growth and low interest rates. This created an environment where investors were willing to pay more for stocks than they were worth. As a result, when investors began selling their stocks in October 1987, prices plummeted as there were not enough buyers to absorb all the selling pressure.</p>
<p>In addition to overvaluation, high levels of debt also contributed to the crash. Many investors had borrowed heavily in order to purchase stocks and when prices began falling they were unable to pay back their loans. This further exacerbated the sell-off as lenders began selling off their assets in order to recoup their losses.</p>
<p>Finally, computerized trading systems played a role in exacerbating the sell-off on Black Monday. These systems allowed traders to rapidly buy and sell large amounts of stock at once which caused prices to fluctuate wildly throughout the day and further accelerated the decline in stock prices.</p>			
<h3>Impact of Black Monday</h3>
<p>The impact of Black Monday was felt around the world as global markets experienced significant losses due to the crash. In total, $500 billion was wiped off global markets on that day alone and many countries entered into recession as a result of the crash.</p>
<p>In addition to economic losses, Black Monday also had psychological effects on investors who had lost money during the crash or seen their investments plummet in value overnight. Many investors became wary of investing in stocks after this event which led them to invest more cautiously or avoid investing altogether for some time afterwards.</p>			
<h3>Lessons Learned from Black Monday</h3>
<p>Black Monday serves as an important reminder that markets can be unpredictable and that caution should be exercised when investing in stocks or other financial instruments. It is important for investors not only understand how markets work but also be aware of potential risks such as overvaluation or excessive borrowing before making any investments decisions.</p>
