                        <p class="article-text">Viber is a popular messaging app that allows users to send messages, make calls, and share photos and videos with other Viber users. It is a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, but it can also be used to message new contacts. Here is how you can use Viber to message new contacts.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you will need to download the Viber app. It is available for both iOS and Android devices, and can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play. Once you have downloaded the app, you will need to create an account. This is a simple process that requires you to enter your phone number and a few other details.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7568299/pexels-photo-7568299.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-shot-of-a-smartphone-screen"><figcaption>picture by Brett Jordan</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once your account is set up, you can start messaging new contacts. To do this, you will need to add the contact to your Viber contacts list. To do this, you can either search for the contact by name or phone number, or you can scan their Viber QR code. Once the contact is added, you can start messaging them.</p><br><p class="article-text">Viber also allows you to make voice and video calls to new contacts. To do this, you will need to open the contact’s profile and select the “Call” or “Video Call” option. You can also share photos and videos with new contacts by selecting the “Share” option in the contact’s profile.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/177707/pexels-photo-177707.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-android-smartphone"><figcaption>picture by Alok Sharma</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Viber also allows you to create group chats with new contacts. To do this, you will need to open the “Groups” tab in the app and select the “Create Group” option. You can then add the contacts you want to include in the group chat.</p><br>
