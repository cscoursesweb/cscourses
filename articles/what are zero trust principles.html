        <p class="article-text">Zero trust principles are a set of security protocols that are designed to protect an organization’s data and systems from malicious actors. The idea behind zero trust is that no user or device should be trusted by default, and all access to the network should be verified and authenticated. This means that even if a user or device is already inside the network, they must still be authenticated before they can access any data or systems.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/45842/clasped-hands-comfort-hands-people-45842.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="2-person-holding-hands"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The concept of zero trust was first developed by John Kindervag, a security analyst at Forrester Research, in 2010. Since then, the idea has been adopted by many organizations as a way to protect their networks from cyber threats.</p><br><p class="article-text">At its core, zero trust is based on the idea of “never trust, always verify.” This means that all users and devices must be authenticated before they can access any data or systems. This authentication process can involve a variety of methods, such as two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, or even physical tokens.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4672717/pexels-photo-4672717.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-people-reaching-each-other-s-hands"><figcaption>picture by Anna Shvets</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The goal of zero trust is to reduce the attack surface of an organization’s network. By requiring authentication for all users and devices, it reduces the chances of an attacker being able to gain access to the network. It also makes it more difficult for attackers to move laterally within the network, as they must be authenticated at each step.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to authentication, zero trust also involves other security measures, such as segmentation and micro-segmentation. Segmentation involves dividing the network into different zones, with each zone having its own set of security protocols. Micro-segmentation takes this a step further, by creating even smaller zones within the network and applying more stringent security protocols to each one.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7219901/pexels-photo-7219901.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="fashion-love-people-woman"><figcaption>picture by Thirdman</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, zero trust also involves monitoring and logging of all user and device activity. This allows organizations to detect any suspicious activity and take action to prevent an attack.</p><br>
