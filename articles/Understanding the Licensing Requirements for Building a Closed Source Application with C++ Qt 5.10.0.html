                        <p class="article-text">In 2018, if you are using C++ Qt 5.10.0 to build a closed source application, you will need to obtain either an open source or commercial license.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers using C++ or QML, a CSS & JavaScript-like language. Qt 5.10.0 is the latest version of the Qt framework, released in December 2017. It is a powerful tool for creating applications for desktop, embedded, and mobile platforms.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5701709/pexels-photo-5701709.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-working-from-home-while-sitting-on-a-couch"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When using Qt to build a closed source application, you will need to obtain either an open source or commercial license. An open source license allows you to use the Qt framework for free, but you must make your source code available to the public. A commercial license allows you to keep your source code private, but you must pay a fee for the license.</p><br><p class="article-text">The type of license you need depends on the type of application you are building. If you are building an application for commercial use, you will need to purchase a commercial license. If you are building an application for non-commercial use, you may be able to use an open source license.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12955940/pexels-photo-12955940.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="exterior-design-of-a-commercial-building"><figcaption>picture by Oleksandr Pidvalnyi</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When deciding which license to use, you should consider the cost, the features offered, and the restrictions of each license. For example, the commercial license may offer more features than the open source license, but it may also be more expensive. Additionally, the open source license may have restrictions on how you can use the code, while the commercial license may not.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that Qt 5.10.0 is not the only version of Qt available. If you are using an older version of Qt, you may need to obtain a different type of license. Additionally, if you are using a different programming language, such as Java or C#, you may need to obtain a different type of license.</p><br>
