<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Tesla Roadster is one of the most highly anticipated electric cars of all time. It promises to be a revolutionary vehicle, with a range of up to 620 miles and a 0-60 mph time of 1.9 seconds. But when will it actually be available for purchase?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on several factors, including production delays, regulatory approval, and customer demand. Here's what we know so far about the Tesla Roadster's release date.</p>

<h3> Production Delays</h3>
<p>Tesla has been known to experience production delays in the past, and the Roadster is no exception. The company originally planned to begin production in 2020, but that timeline has been pushed back due to various issues. As of now, it looks like production won't begin until 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>This delay could be due to a number of factors, including supply chain issues or design changes. Whatever the cause may be, it's clear that Tesla is taking its time with the Roadster in order to ensure that it meets their high standards for quality and performance.</p>

<h3> Regulatory Approval</h3>
<p>In addition to production delays, Tesla must also obtain regulatory approval before they can begin selling the Roadster. This process can take months or even years depending on the country or region in which they plan to sell the car.</p>
<p>For example, in Europe there are strict regulations regarding emissions and safety that must be met before any new vehicle can be sold there. This means that even if Tesla manages to get production up and running by 2021, they may not be able to start selling cars until 2022 or later depending on how long it takes them to get approval from European regulators.</p>

<h3> Customer Demand</h3>
<p>Tesla has already received thousands of pre-orders for the Roadster from customers around the world who are eager for its release date. However, this demand could also affect when Tesla will actually start selling cars as they may need more time than expected in order to fulfill all these orders before they can start selling new vehicles off their lot.</p>			
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>At this point it's difficult to say exactly when Tesla will begin selling their revolutionary new electric car - but one thing is certain: when it does arrive on the market it will be worth waiting for! With its impressive range and performance specs, as well as its sleek design and cutting-edge technology features, there's no doubt that the Tesla Roadster will revolutionize electric vehicles as we know them today!</p>
