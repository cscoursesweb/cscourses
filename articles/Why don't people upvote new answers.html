                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to upvoting new answers on the internet, it can be difficult to understand why people don’t always do it. After all, upvoting is a great way to show appreciation for someone’s hard work and to help them get recognition for their efforts. So why don’t people upvote new answers?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question is complex and can vary from person to person. One of the most common reasons why people don’t upvote new answers is because they don’t think the answer is good enough. This could be because the answer is too short, too long, or simply not well-written. People may also not upvote new answers because they don’t agree with the opinion expressed in the answer.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another reason why people don’t upvote new answers is because they don’t think the answer is relevant to the question. This could be because the answer is off-topic or because the answer is too specific and doesn’t address the broader issue. People may also not upvote new answers because they don’t think the answer is helpful or informative.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, people may not upvote new answers because they don’t think the answer is original. This could be because the answer is too similar to other answers or because the answer is simply a rehash of an existing answer. People may also not upvote new answers because they don’t think the answer is creative or interesting.</p><br>
