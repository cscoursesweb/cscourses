<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When you are searching for a home on Zillow, you may come across listings that are marked as “off market.” This can be confusing and frustrating, especially if you’re in the middle of a home search. So what does it mean when Zillow says “off market”?</p>
<p>In short, an off-market listing is one that is not actively listed for sale. This means that the property is not being advertised or marketed to potential buyers. It could be that the seller has decided to take the property off the market temporarily or permanently, or it could be that the listing has expired and is no longer active.</p>

<h3>Why Would a Property Be Off Market?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons why a property might be off market on Zillow. The most common reason is that the seller has decided to take it off the market temporarily or permanently. This could be due to personal reasons such as needing more time to prepare the home for sale, or financial reasons such as needing more time to save up for closing costs.</p>
<p>Another reason why a property might be off market is because the listing has expired and is no longer active. This could happen if the seller was unable to find a buyer within their desired timeframe, or if they decided to withdraw their listing before it expired.</p>
<p>Finally, some properties may never have been listed in the first place and are simply marked as “off market” on Zillow due to an error in data entry or other technical issues.</p>

<h3>What Should You Do If You Find an Off Market Listing?</h3>
<p>If you find an off-market listing on Zillow that interests you, there are several steps you can take to try and purchase it:</p>
<p>First, contact the listing agent directly and ask them about the status of the property. They may be able to provide more information about why it’s off-market and whether or not it’s still available for purchase.</p>
<p>Second, reach out to other real estate agents in your area who specialize in off-market properties. They may have access to listings that aren’t publicly available yet but could still be available for purchase.</p>
<p>Third, consider contacting local investors who specialize in buying distressed properties or foreclosures. They may have access to properties that aren’t listed yet but could still be available for purchase at a discounted price.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When Zillow says “off market” it means that a property isn’t actively listed for sale at this time but could still potentially be available for purchase depending on its status and availability. If you find an off-market listing on Zillow that interests you, contact the listing agent directly and ask them about its status before reaching out to other real estate agents and investors who specialize in buying distressed properties or foreclosures in your area who may have access to listings not publicly available yet but still potentially available for purchase at a discounted price</p>
