                <title>What is a result of a cross validation process? </title>
                <meta name="description" content="A cross validation process is a method of evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on the other. The result of a cross validation process is an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. This estimate is more reliable than testing the model on a single subset of data, as it provides a better indication of how the model will perform in the real world.">

                        <p class="article-text">Cross validation is a process used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data. The goal of cross validation is to estimate the performance of a model on unseen data, in order to avoid overfitting.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Cross validation is a process of dividing a dataset into two or more subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on the other. This process is repeated multiple times, each time with a different subset of the data. The average performance of the model on all the subsets is then used to estimate the model’s performance on unseen data.</p><br><p class="article-text">Cross validation is a powerful tool for evaluating the performance of a model. It helps to identify the best model for a given dataset, and can be used to compare different models. It also helps to identify potential problems with the model, such as overfitting or underfitting.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The result of a cross validation process is an estimate of the model’s performance on unseen data. This estimate is based on the average performance of the model on the different subsets of the data. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the number of subsets used and the size of each subset.</p><br>
