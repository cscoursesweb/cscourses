                <meta name="description" content="A cross validation process is a method used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on the other. The results of the cross validation process are used to assess the accuracy, reliability, and generalizability of the model. This process helps to identify any potential issues with the model and can be used to tune the model for better performance.">

                        <p class="article-text">Cross validation is a process used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data. The goal of cross validation is to estimate the performance of a model on unseen data, in order to avoid overfitting.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Cross validation is a process of dividing a dataset into two or more subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on the other. This process is repeated multiple times, each time with a different subset of the data. The results of each iteration are then averaged to get an overall estimate of the model’s performance.</p><br><p class="article-text">Cross validation is a powerful tool for evaluating the performance of a model. It helps to identify the best model for a given dataset, and can be used to compare different models.
