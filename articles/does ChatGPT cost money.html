                        <p class="article-text">ChatGPT is a new artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that has been gaining traction in the tech world. It is a natural language processing (NLP) system that can generate conversations with users in real-time. But does ChatGPT cost money?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The short answer is no, ChatGPT is free to use. It is an open-source project, meaning that anyone can access the code and use it for their own projects. This makes it a great option for developers who want to experiment with AI chatbot technology without having to invest in expensive software.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, there are some costs associated with using ChatGPT. For example, if you want to use the system for commercial purposes, you will need to purchase a license. Additionally, if you want to use the system for research purposes, you may need to pay for access to the data sets used to train the system.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to the cost of using ChatGPT, there are also some potential risks associated with the system. For example, the system is still in its early stages and may not be able to handle complex conversations. Additionally, the system is not yet able to detect when a user is being deceptive or malicious.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12950492/pexels-photo-12950492.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-a-cowboy-attempting-to-ride-on-a-wild-horse"><figcaption>picture by @coldbeer</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to note that ChatGPT is still in its early stages and may not be suitable for all applications. If you are looking for a more advanced AI chatbot, you may want to consider other options.</p><br>
