<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Nvidia is one of the leading companies in the computer graphics and gaming industry. It is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets computer graphics processors and related software. Founded in 1993, Nvidia has grown to become one of the most recognizable names in the tech world. But where exactly is Nvidia's headquarter located?</p>
<p>Nvidia's headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California. The company was founded by Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky in 1993 and has since grown to become a major player in the tech industry. The company's headquarters are located at 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95050. This location serves as the main hub for all of Nvidia's operations, including research and development, marketing, sales, customer service, and more.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara headquarters is also home to some of Nvidia's most important products. This includes its flagship GeForce line of graphics cards as well as its Tegra line of mobile processors. In addition to these products, Nvidia also produces a range of other products such as its Quadro professional graphics cards and its Tesla line of AI accelerators.</p>
