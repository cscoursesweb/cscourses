                <meta name="description" content="When bringing on a freelancer, companies should take steps to protect themselves from technological theft. Companies should ensure that the freelancer is trustworthy and has a good reputation. They should also have a contract in place that outlines the terms of the agreement, including the freelancer's obligations to protect the company's data and intellectual property. Companies should also require the freelancer to sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect confidential information. Additionally, companies should use secure file-sharing services and encrypt any sensitive data that is shared with the freelancer. Finally, companies should monitor the freelancer's activity to ensure that they are not misusing the company's data or intellectual property. By taking these steps, companies can protect themselves from technological theft when bringing on a freelancer.">

                        <p class="article-text">When bringing on a freelancer, companies must take steps to protect themselves from technological theft. Technological theft can be a major issue for companies, as it can lead to the loss of valuable data, intellectual property, and other sensitive information. Fortunately, there are a few steps companies can take to protect themselves from technological theft when bringing on a freelancer.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to ensure that the freelancer is trustworthy. Companies should thoroughly vet any freelancer they are considering hiring, including conducting background checks and verifying references. Companies should also consider requiring the freelancer to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect any confidential information they may be exposed to.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3182792/pexels-photo-3182792.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="shallow-focus-photo-of-woman-using-a-laptop"><figcaption>picture by fauxels</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second step is to limit the freelancerâ€™s access to sensitive information. Companies should only provide the freelancer with the information they need to complete the job, and should not give them access to any other sensitive information. Companies should also consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to ensure that any data the freelancer is working with is secure.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third step is to use secure file-sharing services. Companies should avoid using email to share files with the freelancer, as email is not secure. Instead, companies should use a secure file-sharing service, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, to ensure that any files shared with the freelancer are encrypted and secure.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4577718/pexels-photo-4577718.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-standing-near-old-stone-wall-with-carved-images"><figcaption>picture by Rachel Claire</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The fourth step is to use two-factor authentication. Companies should require the freelancer to use two-factor authentication when accessing any sensitive information or systems. This will help to ensure that only the freelancer has access to the information, and that any unauthorized access is quickly detected.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, companies should consider using a contract management system. A contract management system can help to ensure that all contracts and agreements with the freelancer are securely stored and tracked. This will help to ensure that the freelancer is held accountable for any data or information they may have access to.</p><br>
