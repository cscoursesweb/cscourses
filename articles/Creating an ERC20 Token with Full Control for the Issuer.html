                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Making an ERC20 token that the issuer has all controls over the tokens is a relatively simple process. The ERC20 token standard is a set of rules that all tokens must follow in order to be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. By following these rules, the issuer can create a token that they have full control over.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in creating an ERC20 token is to decide on the token’s purpose. This will determine the token’s name, symbol, and total supply. Once these details have been decided, the issuer can begin coding the token.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7203727/pexels-photo-7203727.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="box-with-brain-inscription-on-head-of-anonymous-woman"><figcaption>picture by SHVETS production</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The ERC20 token standard requires that the token have certain functions. These functions include the ability to transfer tokens, check the balance of a token holder, and approve or reject token transfers. The issuer must also include a function that allows them to mint new tokens. This function is important because it allows the issuer to control the total supply of the token.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the code for the token has been written, it must be tested to ensure that it is functioning properly. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or a testnet. Once the code has been tested and is functioning properly, it can be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5846141/pexels-photo-5846141.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-black-safety-gloves-holding-a-grinder"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the token has been deployed, the issuer can begin to control it. This can be done by setting up a smart contract that allows the issuer to mint new tokens, approve or reject token transfers, and check the balance of token holders. The issuer can also set up a system to reward token holders for holding the token, or to incentivize them to use the token.</p><br>
