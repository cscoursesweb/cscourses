                <title>Does minimizing kl divergence (i.e. keep approximate posterior close to prior) contradict the goal of avoiding posterior collapse?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article will explore the question of whether minimizing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, contradicts the goal of avoiding posterior collapse. We will discuss the concept of posterior collapse, the implications of minimizing KL divergence, and the potential consequences of attempting to minimize KL divergence while avoiding posterior collapse. We will also provide examples of how minimizing KL divergence can be used to avoid posterior collapse. Finally, we will discuss the implications of this question for machine learning and artificial intelligence.">

                        <p class="article-text">The goal of avoiding posterior collapse is to ensure that the posterior distribution does not become overly concentrated on a single point, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, on the other hand, is a way of measuring the difference between two probability distributions, and is often used to measure the difference between the prior and posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. While minimizing the KL divergence can help to keep the approximate posterior close to the prior, it does not necessarily contradict the goal of avoiding posterior collapse.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">In Bayesian inference, the prior distribution is used to represent our prior beliefs about the parameters of a model, while the posterior distribution is used to represent our updated beliefs after observing data. The KL divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, and is often used to measure the difference between the prior and posterior distributions. Minimizing the KL divergence can help to ensure that the approximate posterior is close to the prior, which can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, if the prior distribution is known to be accurate, then minimizing the KL divergence can help to ensure that the posterior distribution is also accurate.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">However, minimizing the KL divergence does not necessarily contradict the goal of avoiding posterior collapse. Posterior collapse occurs when the posterior distribution becomes overly concentrated on a single point, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. This can happen even if the KL divergence is minimized, as the posterior distribution can still become overly concentrated on a single point if the prior distribution is too narrow or if the data is too noisy.</p><br>
