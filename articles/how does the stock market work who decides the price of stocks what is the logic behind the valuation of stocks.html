<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The stock market is a complex and ever-changing system that can be difficult to understand. It is a place where investors buy and sell stocks, which are shares of ownership in a company. The price of stocks is determined by the demand for them, which is based on the performance of the company and other factors. In this blog post, we will explore how the stock market works, who decides the price of stocks, and what logic is behind their valuation.</p>

<h3>What is the Stock Market?</h3>
<p>The stock market is an organized marketplace where investors can buy and sell stocks. Stocks are shares of ownership in a company that represent a claim on part of its assets and earnings. When you purchase a stock, you become part owner of that company. The stock market allows investors to buy and sell these shares quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The stock market consists of exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, which are regulated by government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These exchanges provide a platform for buyers and sellers to trade stocks at prices determined by supply and demand.</p>

<h3>Who Decides the Price of Stocks?</h3>
<p>The price of stocks is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace. When there are more buyers than sellers, prices go up; when there are more sellers than buyers, prices go down. This means that investors must pay attention to news about companies they’re interested in investing in so they can make informed decisions about when to buy or sell their shares.</p>
<p>In addition to supply and demand, other factors can influence stock prices such as economic conditions, political events, industry trends, or even rumors about a company’s performance or future prospects. All these factors contribute to how much people are willing to pay for a particular stock at any given time.</p>

<h3>What Logic Is Behind Valuation?</h3>
<p>Fundamental analysis is used by investors to determine whether or not they should invest in a particular company’s stock. This involves looking at financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, etc., as well as analyzing economic trends that could affect the company’s performance over time. By doing this analysis, investors can get an idea of how much money they could potentially make from investing in that particular company’s stock over time.</p>
<p>Technical analysis involves looking at charts that show past trading activity for a particular security or index over time so investors can identify patterns that may indicate future price movements for that security or index. Technical analysts use various indicators such as moving averages or support/resistance levels to help them make predictions about future price movements for securities they’re interested in investing in.</p>
<p>Finally, sentiment analysis looks at how people feel about certain companies or industries based on news articles or social media posts so investors can get an idea of how popular those companies may be with consumers over time which could affect their share prices accordingly.</p>
