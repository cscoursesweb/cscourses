                <title>How to relate the definition for entailment, with soundness and completeness?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Entailment, soundness, and completeness are three important concepts in logic and computer science. Entailment is the relationship between two statements, where one statement logically follows from the other. Soundness is the property of a logical system that ensures that all theorems derived from the system are true. Completeness is the property of a logical system that ensures that all true statements can be derived from the system. In this article, we will explore how these three concepts are related and how they can be used to evaluate the validity of a logical system. We will discuss the definitions of entailment, soundness, and completeness, and how they can be used to determine the validity of a logical system. We will also discuss how these concepts can be used to evaluate the soundness and completeness of a logical system. Finally, we will discuss how these concepts can be used to improve the accuracy of a logical system.">

        <p class="article-text">Entailment is the relationship between two statements, where one statement logically follows from the other. For example, if statement A is true, then statement B must also be true. This is known as the principle of entailment. Entailment is a fundamental concept in logic and mathematics, and is used to determine the validity of arguments and proofs.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1329296/pexels-photo-1329296.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="red-background-with-123456789-text-overlay"><figcaption>picture by Magda Ehlers</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Soundness is a property of a logical system that determines how well it can be used to make valid deductions.
