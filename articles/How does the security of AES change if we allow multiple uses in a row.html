                <meta name="description" content="The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used encryption algorithm that provides strong security for data. In this article, we will discuss how the security of AES changes when multiple uses are allowed in a row, when the key space is limited, and when a filter function is introduced. We will also discuss the implications of these changes and how they can affect the security of AES. Finally, we will provide recommendations for best practices when using AES.">

                        <p class="article-text">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that is used to protect sensitive data. AES is a block cipher, meaning it takes a fixed-length block of plaintext as input and produces a fixed-length block of ciphertext as output. AES is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available, and is used in a variety of applications, from secure web browsing to encrypting data stored on hard drives.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When it comes to the security of AES, there are a few factors that can affect its strength. One of these is the number of times the same key is used in a row. If the same key is used multiple times in a row, it can become easier for an attacker to guess the key and decrypt the data. This is because the same key is used to encrypt multiple blocks of data, and the attacker can use this information to guess the key.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/590022/pexels-photo-590022.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-survey-spreadsheet"><figcaption>picture by Lukas</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The security of AES can also be affected by the size of the key space. The larger the key space, the more difficult it is for an attacker to guess the key. If the key space is too small, it can be easier for an attacker to guess the key and decrypt the data.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the security of AES can be affected by the use of a filter function. A filter function is a mathematical function that is used to reduce the size of the key space. This can make it more difficult for an attacker to guess the key, as the key space is smaller. However, if the filter function is not secure, it can make it easier for an attacker to guess the key and decrypt the data.</p><br>
