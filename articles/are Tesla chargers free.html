<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tesla is a revolutionary company that has changed the way we think about electric vehicles. The company has made electric cars more accessible and affordable than ever before, and they have also developed a network of charging stations to make it easier for drivers to charge their cars. But one question that many people have is whether or not Tesla chargers are free.</p>
<p>The short answer is no, Tesla chargers are not free. However, there are some ways to get discounted or even free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the different ways you can get discounted or free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network.</p>

<h3>Tesla's Supercharger Network</h3>
<p>Tesla's Supercharger network is a network of high-speed charging stations that are designed to quickly charge your car in minutes rather than hours. The Supercharger network is available in most major cities and along major highways, making it easy for drivers to find a place to charge their car when they're on the go.</p>
<p>The cost of using the Supercharger network varies depending on where you're located and how much electricity you use. Generally speaking, it costs around $0.26 per kWh of electricity used, which works out to around $10-$15 for a full charge depending on your car's battery size.</p>

<h3>Discounted Charging with Referral Programs</h3>
<p>One way to get discounted or even free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network is through referral programs. If you refer someone else to buy a Tesla vehicle, both you and the person you referred will receive 1,000 miles of free Supercharging credit (which works out to around $100-$150 worth of free charging). This referral program can be used multiple times if you refer multiple people, so it can be an easy way to get discounted or even free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network.</p>			
<h3>Discounted Charging with Promotions</h3>
<p>Another way to get discounted or even free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network is through promotions and discounts offered by third-party companies such as hotels and restaurants near the Superchargers. These companies often offer discounts on meals or hotel stays if you show them your Tesla key fob when paying for your meal or stay. These discounts can range from 10% off up to 50% off depending on the promotion, so it can be an easy way to save money while charging your car at the same time.</p>

<h3>Discounted Charging with Credit Cards</h3>
<p>Finally, some credit cards offer rewards points that can be used towards discounted or even free charging at Tesla's Supercharger network. For example, some American Express cards offer rewards points that can be redeemed for up to $50 worth of free charging per month (up to $600 per year). This can be an easy way to save money while still taking advantage of all the benefits that come with owning an electric vehicle such as lower fuel costs and fewer emissions compared with traditional gasoline-powered cars.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while Tesla chargers are not technically “free” there are several ways that drivers can get discounted or even free charging at Tesla’s Supercharger Network including referral programs, promotions from third-party companies near the chargers and rewards points from certain credit cards. By taking advantage of these options drivers can save money while still enjoying all the benefits that come with owning an electric vehicle such as lower fuel costs and fewer emissions compared with traditional gasoline-powered cars</p>
