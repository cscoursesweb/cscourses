<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Amazon is one of the world's largest online retailers, and it has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 1994. Founded by Jeff Bezos, Amazon started out as an online bookstore and has since grown to become a global powerhouse in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. In this blog post, we'll take a look at how Amazon got its start and how it has evolved over the years.</p>

<h3> The Early Years: From Bookstore to Marketplace</h3>
<p>When Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in 1994, he had a vision of creating an online bookstore that would offer customers a wide selection of books at competitive prices. To make this vision a reality, Bezos invested $300,000 of his own money and raised an additional $1 million from family and friends. With this funding, he was able to launch Amazon in July 1995 with just five employees.</p>
<p>At first, Amazon was just an online bookstore that sold books from major publishers like HarperCollins and Penguin Random House. However, Bezos quickly realized that there was potential for growth beyond books. In 1997, he launched the Marketplace program which allowed third-party sellers to list their products on Amazon's website. This move opened up the platform to millions of new products and allowed small businesses to reach customers around the world.</p>
<p>In 1998, Amazon went public with an initial public offering (IPO) of 18 million shares at $18 per share. This IPO raised $54 million for the company which allowed them to expand their operations even further. By 1999, they had expanded into music and video sales as well as electronics and toys.</p>			
<h3> Expansion into New Markets: From Books to Everything Else</h3>
<p>In 2000, Amazon continued its expansion into new markets by launching its own payment system called Amazon Payments which allowed customers to pay for items using their credit cards or bank accounts without having to enter their information each time they made a purchase. This move made it easier for customers to shop on the site while also increasing security for both buyers and sellers alike.</p>
<p>The following year saw the launch of Prime membership which offered customers free two-day shipping on all orders over $25 as well as access to exclusive deals on select items. This move proved popular with customers who were looking for convenience when shopping online and helped drive more traffic to the site while also increasing customer loyalty.</p>
<p>In 2002, Amazon launched its Web Services (AWS) platform which provided developers with access to powerful cloud computing resources such as storage space and computing power at competitive prices. This move helped make cloud computing more accessible for businesses of all sizes while also allowing them to save money on infrastructure costs associated with running their own servers or data centers.</p>

<h3> The Future: Artificial Intelligence & Beyond</h3>
<p>Today, Amazon is still expanding into new markets with its focus now shifting towards artificial intelligence (AI). In 2017 they launched Alexa – an AI-powered virtual assistant – which can be used for tasks such as playing music or ordering groceries from home using voice commands alone. They have also developed AI-powered facial recognition technology which can be used by law enforcement agencies or businesses for security purposes or customer identification purposes respectively.</p>
<p>Amazon is also investing heavily in research & development (R&D) in order to stay ahead of competitors such as Google or Microsoft who are also investing heavily in AI technology themselves. With these investments they hope to continue innovating new products & services that will help them remain competitive in the future while continuing their mission of making life easier for customers around the world through technology & innovation</p>
