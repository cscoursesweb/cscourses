                        <p class="article-text">The answer to the question of whether there is stigma associated with self-answers on certain network sites or different etiquette is yes. Self-answers, or answers that are posted by the same person who asked the question, are often seen as a sign of desperation or lack of knowledge. This can lead to other users viewing the self-answers as less credible or trustworthy.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The stigma associated with self-answers is rooted in the idea that the person asking the question should be able to find the answer on their own. This is especially true in online communities where users are expected to do their own research before asking a question. If a user posts a self-answer, it can be seen as a sign that they are not taking the time to do their own research or that they are not knowledgeable enough to find the answer on their own.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to the stigma associated with self-answers, there is also a different etiquette that is expected when posting self-answers. For example, it is generally considered bad form to post a self-answer immediately after asking the question. This is seen as a sign of impatience and can be off-putting to other users. It is also important to be aware of the tone of the self-answer. If the self-answer is overly boastful or self-congratulatory, it can be seen as arrogant and can be off-putting to other users.</p><br>
