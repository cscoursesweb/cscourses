<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Roblox is a popular online game platform that allows users to create their own games and play games created by other users. It has become increasingly popular over the years, with millions of players logging in every day. But what programming language does Roblox use?</p>
<p>Roblox is powered by a custom-built scripting language called Roblox Lua. This language is based on the popular programming language Lua, which was designed to be easy to learn and use. Roblox Lua is used to create the game logic for all of the games on the platform, as well as for creating user interfaces and other features.</p>

<h3>What Is Lua?</h3>
<p>Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language designed for embedded systems and applications. It was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes at Tecgraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil).</p>
<p>Lua is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. This makes it ideal for rapid prototyping and development of applications that require frequent changes or updates. It also makes it easier to debug code since errors can be identified quickly without having to recompile the entire program.</p>
<p>Lua has a simple syntax that makes it easy to learn and use. It also has powerful features such as garbage collection, dynamic typing, first-class functions, closures, coroutines, iterators, modules, multiple return values, tail calls and more. These features make it an ideal choice for game development due to its flexibility and performance.</p>

<h3>How Is Roblox Lua Different From Regular Lua?</h3>
<p>Roblox Lua is based on regular Lua but with some modifications made specifically for use in Roblox games. The main difference between regular Lua and Roblox Lua is that Roblox adds additional functions that are specific to its platform such as functions related to 3D graphics rendering or networking capabilities.</p>
<p>Roblox also adds additional data types such as Vector3 (a 3D vector) or CFrame (a coordinate frame) which are used extensively in game development on the platform. Additionally, Roblox provides access to its API which allows developers to access various features of the platform such as user authentication or leaderboard functionality without having to write any code themselves.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, Roblox uses a custom scripting language called Roblox Lua which is based on regular Lua but with some modifications made specifically for use in Roblox games. This language provides developers with powerful features such as garbage collection or dynamic typing while also providing access to various features of the platform through its API so developers don't have to write any code themselves if they don't want too.</p>
