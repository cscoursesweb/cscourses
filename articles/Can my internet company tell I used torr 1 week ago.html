        <p class="article-text">The short answer is yes, your internet company can tell if you used Torr 1 week ago. Torr is a free, open-source software that allows users to access the internet anonymously. It does this by routing your internet traffic through a network of volunteer-run servers, making it difficult for anyone to trace your activity.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/66100/pexels-photo-66100.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="brown-wooden-arrow-signed"><figcaption>picture by Jens Johnsson</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, while Torr can help you remain anonymous online, it is not completely foolproof. Your internet company can still tell if you used Torr 1 week ago, as they can track your IP address and other identifying information. This means that if you used Torr 1 week ago, your internet company will be able to tell.</p><br><p class="article-text">That said, it is important to note that your internet company will not be able to tell what you did while using Torr. They will only be able to tell that you used Torr, not what websites you visited or what you did while using it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/66100/pexels-photo-66100.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="brown-wooden-arrow-signed"><figcaption>picture by Jens Johnsson</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">It is also important to note that while your internet company can tell if you used Torr 1 week ago, they may not be able to tell if you are currently using Torr. This is because Torr is designed to be difficult to trace, and your internet company may not be able to tell if you are currently using it.</p><br>
