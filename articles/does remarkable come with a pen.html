<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The reMarkable 2 is a paper tablet that replaces your notebooks and printed documents with a 10.3" display. It is 4.7 mm thin and weighs 403.5 g, making it one of the most lightweight tablets on the market. It has 8 GB internal storage, 1 GB LPDDR3 SDRAM, and runs on a 1.2 GHz dual-core ARM processor with a custom Linux-based OS. The tablet supports PDF and ePUB file formats and features palm rejection for accurate writing and drawing. It has no backlight and charges via USB-C, so you can easily keep it charged while you’re on the go. It also automatically syncs to your phone and computer with the reMarkable cloud service, so you can access your documents from anywhere. With its long battery life of up to two weeks, you won’t have to worry about running out of power when you need it most.</p>
<p>But one question many people have when considering buying the reMarkable 2 is: does it come with a pen? In this article, we’ll answer that question in detail so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not this tablet is right for you.</p>
<img class="article-image" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2070069/pexels-photo-2070069.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" alt="vpn-box" decoding="async” loading=" lazy">			
<h3>What Comes in the Box?</h3>
<p>When you purchase the reMarkable 2, it comes with everything you need to get started right away: the tablet itself, a USB-C charging cable, an extra pen tip, and an instruction manual. Unfortunately, however, it does not come with a pen included in the box – but don’t worry! You can purchase one separately from Amazon or directly from reMarkable for just $49 USD (<a href='https://amzn.to/3Y7PgRc'>reMarkable 2 on Amazon</a>).</p>
<p>The pen that comes with the reMarkable 2 is designed specifically for use on this device – it has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity for precise writing and drawing, as well as palm rejection technology so that your hand won’t interfere with what you’re doing onscreen. The pen also has two buttons which can be programmed to do different things depending on what app or program you’re using – for example, they could be used as shortcuts for undoing or redoing actions in certain programs like Adobe Photoshop or Sketchbook Pro.</p>			
<h3>What Other Pens Can I Use?</h3>
<p>If you already have another stylus or digital pen lying around that isn’t specifically designed for use on the reMarkable 2 tablet – such as an Apple Pencil or Samsung S Pen – then unfortunately these won’t work on this device either due to compatibility issues between different brands of pens and tablets. However, if you do have one of these pens lying around then there are some third-party adapters available which will allow them to be used on the reMarkable 2 – although these adapters are not officially supported by either Apple or Samsung so they may not work perfectly every time (<a href='https://amzn.to/3Y7PgRc'>reMarkable 2 on Amazon</a>).</p>

<h3>Should I Buy a Pen Separately?</h3>
<p>Whether or not you should buy a separate pen for your reMarkable 2 really depends on how much writing and drawing you plan to do on this device – if it’s going to be mainly used for reading books then there may be no need to buy an additional pen since most books don’t require any input from your side other than turning pages! However if you plan to use this device for taking notes in lectures or classes then having an additional pen would definitely be beneficial since it would allow you to write down important information quickly without having to pause every few seconds while waiting for your finger input to register onscreen (<a href='https://amzn.to/3Y7PgRc'>reMarkable 2 on Amazon</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, whether or not the reMarkable 2 comes with a pen really depends on how much writing and drawing you plan to do on this device – if it’s mainly going to be used for reading books then there may be no need to buy an additional pen since most books don’t require any input from your side other than turning pages!
