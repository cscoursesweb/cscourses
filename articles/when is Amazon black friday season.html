<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Black Friday is one of the most anticipated shopping days of the year, and Amazon is one of the biggest players in the game. Every year, Amazon offers amazing deals on a wide range of products, from electronics to home goods. But when exactly does Amazon’s Black Friday season start?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors. First, it depends on when Amazon decides to launch its Black Friday sales. Second, it depends on when other retailers decide to launch their own Black Friday sales. Finally, it depends on how long each retailer’s sale lasts.</p>

<h3>When Does Amazon Launch Its Black Friday Sales?</h3>
<p>Amazon typically launches its Black Friday sales in late October or early November. This year, Amazon launched its Black Friday sales on October 26th. The sale will last until December 2nd, giving shoppers plenty of time to take advantage of all the great deals that are available.</p>
<p>Amazon usually releases new deals throughout the sale period, so shoppers should keep an eye out for new offers as they become available. Additionally, some products may be discounted for longer than others, so shoppers should pay attention to the expiration dates for each deal they’re interested in taking advantage of.</p>

<h3>When Do Other Retailers Launch Their Black Friday Sales?</h3>
<p>Other retailers typically launch their own Black Friday sales around the same time as Amazon does. This year, many retailers launched their sales on October 26th as well. However, some retailers may choose to launch their sales earlier or later than Amazon does. It’s important for shoppers to keep an eye out for any early or late launches so they can take advantage of any additional savings that may be available from those retailers.</p>
<p>Additionally, some retailers may choose to extend their sales beyond December 2nd while others may end them earlier than that date. Again, it’s important for shoppers to pay attention to expiration dates so they don’t miss out on any great deals that may be available from those retailers before they expire.</p>			
<h3>How Long Does Each Retailer's Sale Last?</h3>
<p>The length of each retailer’s sale will vary depending on when they decide to launch it and how long they decide to extend it beyond December 2nd (if at all). Some retailers may offer discounts for only a few days while others may offer discounts for weeks or even months at a time. It’s important for shoppers to pay attention to expiration dates so they don’t miss out on any great deals that may be available from those retailers before they expire.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, Amazon typically launches its Black Friday sales in late October or early November and other retailers usually follow suit shortly after that date with their own sales launches and extensions beyond December 2nd (if at all). Shoppers should keep an eye out for new offers as they become available and pay attention to expiration dates so they don’t miss out on any great deals that may be available from those retailers before they expire!</p>
