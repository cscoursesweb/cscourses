                <title>Exploring the Relationship Between Entailment, Soundness, and Completeness</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article explores the relationship between three important concepts in logic: entailment, soundness, and completeness. Entailment is the relationship between two statements, where one statement logically follows from the other. Soundness is the property of an argument or inference that it is valid and all its premises are true. Completeness is the property of a set of axioms or a logical system that every statement that is true can be proven from the axioms. We will discuss how these concepts are related and how they are used in logic. We will also look at examples of entailment, soundness, and completeness in action. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these concepts for logical reasoning.">

        <p class="article-text">Entailment is the relationship between two statements, where one statement logically follows from the other. For example, if we have the statement “All cats are animals”, then the statement “My cat is an animal” logically follows from it. This is an example of entailment.</p><br><p class="article-text">Soundness is a property of a logical system that determines how well it can be used to make valid deductions. A logical system is sound if and only if all of the deductions it makes are valid. In other words, if a logical system is sound, then all of the conclusions it reaches are true.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Completeness is another property of a logical system that determines how well it can be used to make valid deductions. A logical system is complete if and only if it can be used to make all valid deductions. In other words, if a logical system is complete, then it can be used to make all valid deductions.</p><br>
