                        <p class="article-text">ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that has been gaining traction in the tech world. It is a natural language processing (NLP) system that can generate conversations with users in real-time. But is ChatGPT open source?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The short answer is no. ChatGPT is not open source. It is a proprietary technology developed by the company OpenAI. OpenAI is a research laboratory that focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are a for-profit company and have not released the source code for ChatGPT.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/373543/pexels-photo-373543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blue-bright-lights"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, OpenAI does offer a free version of ChatGPT that can be used for research and development purposes. This version is limited in its capabilities and is not suitable for commercial use. It is also not open source, as the source code is not available.</p><br><p class="article-text">OpenAI has also released a paid version of ChatGPT that is suitable for commercial use.

                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that OpenAI is not the only company that offers AI chatbot technology. There are other companies that offer open source chatbot solutions. These solutions are typically more limited in their capabilities than ChatGPT, but they are free to use and the source code is available.</p><br>
