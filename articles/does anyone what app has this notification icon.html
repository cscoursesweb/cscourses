                        <p class="article-text">The answer to the question of which app has a particular notification icon depends on the icon itself. There are a variety of apps that use similar icons, so it can be difficult to determine which one is associated with a particular icon. However, there are a few steps you can take to help narrow down the possibilities.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, take a screenshot of the icon and save it to your computer. Then, use a reverse image search engine, such as Google Images or TinEye, to search for the icon. This will bring up a list of websites that have used the icon, which can help you identify the app it belongs to.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/114820/pexels-photo-114820.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="elvis-presley-digital-wallpaper"><figcaption>picture by Mike B</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If the reverse image search doesn’t yield any results, you can also try searching for the icon on social media platforms, such as Twitter or Instagram. Many apps use their icons as part of their branding, so searching for the icon on social media can help you identify the app it belongs to.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re still having trouble identifying the app, you can try searching for the icon on app stores, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Many apps use their icons as part of their app store listings, so searching for the icon on the app store can help you identify the app it belongs to.</p><br>
