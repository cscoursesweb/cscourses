                        <p class="article-text">If you are licensing a website to a client, it is important to ensure that the copyright on the site is properly stated. Copyright is a form of intellectual property protection that grants the creator of a work exclusive rights to the use and distribution of their work. It is important to include a copyright statement on your website to protect your client’s intellectual property and to ensure that they are properly credited for their work.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When creating a copyright statement for a website, there are a few key elements that should be included. First, the copyright statement should include the name of the copyright holder. This should be the name of the client who owns the website. The copyright statement should also include the year the website was created or last updated. This will help to ensure that the copyright is up to date and that the client is properly credited for their work.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8216852/pexels-photo-8216852.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="food-wood-internet-dinner"><figcaption>picture by Suryq</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In addition to the name of the copyright holder and the year the website was created or last updated, the copyright statement should also include a statement of rights. This statement should indicate that the copyright holder has exclusive rights to the use and distribution of the website. This statement should also indicate that any unauthorized use or distribution of the website is prohibited.</p><br><p class="article-text">Finally, the copyright statement should include a statement of liability. This statement should indicate that the copyright holder is not liable for any damages or losses that may result from the use or distribution of the website. This statement should also indicate that the copyright holder is not responsible for any errors or omissions that may be found on the website.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/762687/pexels-photo-762687.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="open-textbook"><figcaption>picture by Jess Bailey Designs</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">By including all of these elements in the copyright statement, you can ensure that your client’s intellectual property is properly protected and that they are properly credited for their work. It is important to note that copyright laws vary from country to country, so it is important to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the copyright statement is in compliance with the laws of the country in which the website is being licensed.</p><br>
