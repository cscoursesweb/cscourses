        <p class="article-text">When it comes to backing up photos on your Android device, OneDrive and Google Photos are two of the most popular options. Both services offer a convenient way to store and access your photos, but what happens to those photos once you delete them from your device’s storage?</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/346529/pexels-photo-346529.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="calm-body-of-lake-between-mountains"><figcaption>picture by Bri Schneiter</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When you delete a photo from your device’s storage, it is removed from the device itself, but it is not necessarily removed from the cloud storage service. Depending on the service you are using, the photo may still be stored in the cloud.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you are using OneDrive, the photo will remain in the cloud until you manually delete it. You can do this by logging into your OneDrive account and deleting the photo from there. Once you delete the photo from OneDrive, it will be permanently removed from the cloud.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7275743/pexels-photo-7275743.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-doing-bike-trick"><figcaption>picture by Leandro Louzeiro</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you are using Google Photos, the photo will remain in the cloud until you delete it from the Google Photos app. When you delete a photo from the Google Photos app, it will be removed from the cloud as well.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that when you delete a photo from your device’s storage, it may still be stored in the cloud. Therefore, it is important to make sure that you delete the photo from the cloud storage service as well if you want it to be permanently removed.</p><br>
