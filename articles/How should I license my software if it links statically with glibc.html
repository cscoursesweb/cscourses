                <meta name="description" content="If you are developing software that links statically with glibc, it is important to understand the licensing implications of doing so. In this article, we will discuss the various licensing options available for software that links statically with glibc, and provide guidance on how to choose the best option for your project. We will also discuss the potential risks associated with static linking, and how to mitigate them. Finally, we will provide resources for further information on licensing and static linking.">

                        <p class="article-text">If you are developing software that links statically with glibc, you need to be aware of the licensing implications of doing so. In this article, we will discuss the various licensing options available to you and how to choose the best one for your software.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, it is important to understand what glibc is and why it is important. Glibc is the GNU C Library, a collection of standard C library functions that are used by many programs. It is an essential part of the GNU/Linux operating system and is used by many other programs as well.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/159778/books-reading-series-narnia-159778.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="the-chronicles-of-narnia-book"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When you link your software statically with glibc, you are essentially including the glibc code in your software. This means that you must comply with the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) which governs the use of glibc. The GPL requires that any software that links statically with glibc must also be released under the GPL.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, this does not mean that you must release your software under the GPL. There are other licensing options available to you. For example, you could choose to release your software under a proprietary license, such as a commercial license. This would allow you to keep your software closed source and charge for it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4489744/pexels-photo-4489744.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-black-and-white-crew-neck-t-shirt-standing-near-red-and-black-wall"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Alternatively, you could choose to release your software under a copyleft license, such as the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This would allow you to keep your software open source, but also allow you to charge for it.</p><br><p class="article-text">Finally, you could choose to release your software under a permissive license, such as the MIT License. This would allow you to keep your software open source and free to use.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1476321/pexels-photo-1476321.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blue-and-yellow-phone-modules"><figcaption>picture by Dan Cristian Pădureț</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Ultimately, the choice of which license to use for your software is up to you. However, it is important to understand the implications of each license and how it will affect your software.</p><br>
