<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Low volatility investing is a strategy that seeks to minimize the risk of losses by investing in assets with low volatility. This type of investing is often used by investors who are looking to reduce their exposure to market volatility and protect their capital from large losses. The idea behind low volatility investing is that it can provide a steady return over time, while still providing some protection against market downturns.</p>
<p>At its core, low volatility investing is based on the concept of diversification. By diversifying your investments across different asset classes, you can reduce the risk of large losses due to market downturns. This type of investing also allows you to take advantage of opportunities in different markets, as well as benefit from the potential for higher returns when markets are performing well.</p>
<p>Betting against correlation is another strategy that can be used in conjunction with low volatility investing. This strategy involves betting against correlations between different asset classes or markets. By betting against correlations, investors can potentially benefit from market movements that are not correlated with each other. For example, if one asset class is performing well while another is performing poorly, betting against correlation could allow an investor to benefit from both movements at the same time.</p>
