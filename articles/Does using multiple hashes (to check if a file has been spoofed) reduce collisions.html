                <meta name="description" content="This article will discuss the use of multiple hashes to check if a file has been spoofed and whether or not this reduces collisions. We will look at the advantages and disadvantages of using multiple hashes, as well as the potential security implications. We will also discuss the different types of hashes available and how they can be used to reduce collisions. Finally, we will provide some tips on how to best use multiple hashes to ensure the security of your files.">

                        <p class="article-text">The answer to the question of whether using multiple hashes to check if a file has been spoofed reduces collisions is yes. Hashing is a process of taking a file and creating a unique identifier for it, usually in the form of a string of characters. This identifier is known as a hash. When a file is hashed, it is compared to a database of known hashes to determine if the file is legitimate or has been spoofed.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Using multiple hashes to check if a file has been spoofed reduces the chances of collisions, which is when two different files have the same hash. This is because each hash algorithm produces a different result, so if two different hashes are used, the chances of two different files having the same hash are much lower.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4792282/pexels-photo-4792282.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="briefcase-with-documents-placed-on-table"><figcaption>picture by Anete Lusina</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">For example, if a file is hashed using the MD5 algorithm, it is possible that two different files could have the same hash. However, if the same file is hashed using both the MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms, the chances of two different files having the same hash are much lower.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition to reducing the chances of collisions, using multiple hashes to check if a file has been spoofed also increases the security of the file. This is because if a malicious actor were to try to spoof a file, they would have to create a file that produces the same hash for both algorithms, which is much more difficult than creating a file that produces the same hash for just one algorithm.</p><br>
