        <p class="article-text">Kotlin is a powerful programming language that is quickly becoming a popular choice for developers. One of the features that makes Kotlin so attractive is its ability to easily access data from child objects. This is done through the use of member references, which allow developers to quickly and easily access data from child objects. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to use member references to grab data from child objects in Kotlin.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6270276/pexels-photo-6270276.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-guitarist-singing-onstage-at-a-live-performance"><figcaption>picture by Artem Podrez</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">First, let’s take a look at what a member reference is. A member reference is a way of referring to a specific member of an object. For example, if you have an object called “Person”, you could refer to the “name” member of that object by using the member reference “Person.name”. This is a powerful tool that allows developers to quickly and easily access data from child objects.</p><br><p class="article-text">Now that we know what a member reference is, let’s take a look at how to use them to grab data from child objects in Kotlin. The first step is to create a reference to the child object. This can be done by using the “get()” function. For example, if you have an object called “Person” and you want to access the “name” member of that object, you would use the following code:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6774452/pexels-photo-6774452.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="smiling-multiracial-coworkers-with-hands-together-in-office"><figcaption>picture by Kindel Media</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">val name = Person.get("name")</p><br><p class="article-text">This code will create a reference to the “name” member of the “Person” object. Once you have a reference to the child object, you can then use the “getValue()” function to access the data from the child object. For example, if you wanted to access the “age” member of the “Person” object, you would use the following code:</p><br><p class="article-text">val age = Person.getValue("age")</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">This code will return the value of the “age” member of the “Person” object.</p><br>
