                <meta name="description" content="When adjusting the parent's z scale of a child with a Sprite Renderer in Unity, the child's Sprite Renderer will be scaled along the z-axis. This means that the child's Sprite Renderer will be stretched or compressed in the z-axis, depending on the scale value. This transformation can be used to create interesting effects, such as making a character appear to be further away or closer to the camera. Additionally, adjusting the parent's z scale can be used to create a sense of depth in a 2D game.">
