                        <p class="article-text">If you’re a Windows 10 user, you’ve probably noticed that the right-click context menu can become cluttered with applications and other items. This can make it difficult to find the application you’re looking for, or to quickly access the application you need. Fortunately, there are a few ways to arrange the applications in the right-click context menu in Windows 10.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first way to arrange the applications in the right-click context menu is to use the “Pin to Start” feature. This feature allows you to pin an application to the Start menu, which will then appear in the right-click context menu. To use this feature, simply right-click on the application you want to pin and select “Pin to Start”. The application will then appear in the Start menu and in the right-click context menu.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12725461/pexels-photo-12725461.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-brown-envelope-on-a-wooden-table"><figcaption>picture by ROMAN ODINTSOV</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second way to arrange the applications in the right-click context menu is to use the “Organize” feature. This feature allows you to organize the applications in the right-click context menu by dragging and dropping them into the desired order. To use this feature, simply right-click on the application you want to organize and select “Organize”. You can then drag and drop the applications into the desired order.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third way to arrange the applications in the right-click context menu is to use the “Sort by” feature. This feature allows you to sort the applications in the right-click context menu by name, type, date, or size. To use this feature, simply right-click on the application you want to sort and select “Sort by”. You can then select the desired sorting option.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fourth way to arrange the applications in the right-click context menu is to use the “Group by” feature.
