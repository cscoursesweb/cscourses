                <title>Is it possible to run a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS with low RAM?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Yes, it is possible to run a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS with low RAM. While the exact amount of RAM needed will depend on the type of relay or proxy you are running, it is possible to run a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS with as little as 512MB of RAM. However, it is important to note that running a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS with low RAM may result in slower speeds and decreased performance. Additionally, it is recommended to have at least 1GB of RAM for optimal performance.">

                        <p class="article-text">Running a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS with low RAM is possible, but it is not recommended. Tor is a network of volunteer-run servers that help anonymize internet traffic by routing it through multiple nodes. It is a popular tool for protecting privacy and circumventing censorship.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The amount of RAM available on a Synology NAS is a major factor in determining whether it can run a Tor relay or proxy. Tor requires a minimum of 512MB of RAM to run, and it is recommended to have at least 1GB of RAM for optimal performance. If your Synology NAS has less than 512MB of RAM, it is not recommended to run a Tor relay or proxy on it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/41951/solar-system-emergence-spitzer-telescope-telescope-41951.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="red-and-orange-galaxy-illustration"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, if your Synology NAS has more than 512MB of RAM, it is possible to run a Tor relay or proxy on it. The first step is to install the Tor package from the Synology Package Center. Once the package is installed, you can configure the Tor relay or proxy settings in the Tor Control Panel.</p><br><p class="article-text">When configuring the Tor relay or proxy settings, it is important to consider the amount of RAM available on the Synology NAS. If the RAM is limited, it is recommended to set the bandwidth limits to a lower value. This will help ensure that the Tor relay or proxy does not consume too much RAM and cause the Synology NAS to become unresponsive.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/355069/pexels-photo-355069.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="analog-analog-camera-antique-aperture"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">It is also important to consider the network connection when running a Tor relay or proxy on a Synology NAS. If the network connection is slow or unreliable, it is recommended to set the bandwidth limits to a lower value. This will help ensure that the Tor relay or proxy does not consume too much bandwidth and cause the Synology NAS to become unresponsive.</p><br>
