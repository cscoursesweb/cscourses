                <title>Why aren't there any access points found in the output from aireplay-ng while I can see two access points in the output of airodump-ng?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article will explain why there are no access points found in the output from aireplay-ng, even though two access points can be seen in the output of airodump-ng. Aireplay-ng is a tool used to inject packets into a wireless network, while airodump-ng is used to capture packets from a wireless network. Aireplay-ng requires an access point to be present in order to inject packets, while airodump-ng can capture packets from any wireless network, even if there is no access point present. Therefore, it is possible to see two access points in the output of airodump-ng, but not in the output of aireplay-ng.">

        <p class="article-text">Aireplay-ng is a packet injection tool used to test the security of a wireless network. It can be used to inject packets into a wireless network in order to test the network's security. Aireplay-ng can also be used to perform denial of service attacks, as well as to capture and replay wireless packets.</p><br><p class="article-text">Airodump-ng, on the other hand, is a wireless network sniffer. It is used to capture and analyze wireless network traffic. Airodump-ng can be used to monitor the traffic of a wireless network, as well as to capture and analyze packets.</p><br><p class="article-text">The reason why there are no access points found in the output from aireplay-ng is because aireplay-ng is not designed to detect access points. Aireplay-ng is designed to inject packets into a wireless network, not to detect access points.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Airodump-ng, on the other hand, is designed to detect access points. Airodump-ng can be used to scan for access points and to capture and analyze packets. This is why you can see two access points in the output of airodump-ng, but not in the output of aireplay-ng.</p><br>
