                        <p class="article-text">Printing code from GitHub.com with its syntax-highlighting is a great way to share your code with others. It allows you to easily show off your code and make it easier to read and understand. In this article, we’ll show you how to print code from GitHub.com with its syntax-highlighting.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you’ll need to find the code you want to print. You can do this by navigating to the repository you want to print code from. Once you’ve found the code you want to print, you can click the “Raw” button to view the code in its raw form.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4484078/pexels-photo-4484078.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-bubble-jacket-holding-tablet-computer"><figcaption>picture by Tiger Lily</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you’ll need to copy the code. You can do this by selecting the code and pressing “Ctrl + C” on your keyboard. Once you’ve copied the code, you can paste it into a text editor of your choice.</p><br><p class="article-text">Now that you’ve pasted the code into a text editor, you’ll need to add syntax-highlighting. To do this, you’ll need to select the language you’re using from the drop-down menu. Once you’ve selected the language, the text editor will automatically highlight the code with the appropriate syntax.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you’ll need to print the code. To do this, you can press “Ctrl + P” on your keyboard. This will open the print dialog box, where you can select the printer you want to use and the number of copies you want to print. Once you’ve selected the printer and the number of copies, you can click “Print” to print the code with its syntax-highlighting.</p><br>
