                <meta name="description" content="A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that is used for supervised learning tasks. While MLPs are powerful tools for solving complex problems, they can struggle with simple regression problems. This is because MLPs are designed to learn complex patterns and relationships between data points, and simple regression problems do not require the same level of complexity. Additionally, MLPs require a large amount of data to learn effectively, and simple regression problems often have limited data available. As a result, MLPs can struggle to learn simple regression problems, and other methods may be more suitable.">

                        <p class="article-text">Machine learning is a powerful tool for solving complex problems, but it can be difficult to understand why certain problems are more difficult for an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to learn than others. One such problem is a simple regression problem, which is a type of supervised learning task that involves predicting a continuous numerical output from a set of input variables. While MLPs are capable of learning complex relationships between inputs and outputs, they can struggle with simple regression problems due to a few key factors.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first factor is the nature of the data. Simple regression problems typically involve a single input variable and a single output variable, which means that the data is relatively simple and there are fewer variables to consider. This can make it difficult for an MLP to learn the underlying relationships between the input and output variables, as there is less data to work with. Additionally, the data may not be linearly separable, meaning that the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the relationship between the input and output variables.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/592753/pexels-photo-592753.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="world-map-illustration"><figcaption>picture by Aaditya Arora</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second factor is the complexity of the problem. Simple regression problems are often relatively straightforward, meaning that the MLP may not be able to identify the underlying patterns in the data. This can be especially true if the data is noisy or contains outliers, as the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the patterns in the data. Additionally, the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the relationship between the input and output variables if the data is non-linear.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third factor is the size of the dataset. Simple regression problems typically involve a small dataset, which can make it difficult for an MLP to learn the underlying patterns in the data. This is because the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the patterns in the data if there is not enough data to work with. Additionally, the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the relationship between the input and output variables if the dataset is too small.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326461/pexels-photo-326461.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="macro-shot-of-water-drops-on-leaf"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fourth factor is the complexity of the model. Simple regression problems typically involve a relatively simple model, which can make it difficult for an MLP to learn the underlying patterns in the data. This is because the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the patterns in the data if the model is too complex. Additionally, the MLP may not be able to accurately identify the relationship between the input and output variables if the model is too complex.</p><br>
