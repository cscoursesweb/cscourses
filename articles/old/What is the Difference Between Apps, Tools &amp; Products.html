                <meta name="description" content="This article will explain the differences between apps, tools, and products. Apps are software applications that are designed to perform specific tasks on a mobile device or computer. Tools are pieces of software that are used to help with a specific task or process. Products are the end result of a process or task, such as a website, software, or hardware. We will discuss the differences between these three terms and how they are used in the tech industry. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of software. Finally, we will provide examples of each type of software and how they are used in the tech industry.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to technology, there is often confusion between the terms “apps,” “tools,” and “products.” While these terms are often used interchangeably, they actually have distinct meanings. Understanding the differences between these terms can help you better understand the technology you use every day.</p><br>

Apps are typically designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, but they can also be used on desktop computers. Apps are usually designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, and they can range from simple games to complex productivity tools.</p><br><p class="article-text">Tools</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2002429/pexels-photo-2002429.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="mug-in-front-of-breads-beside-spatulas-on-table"><figcaption>picture by lalesh aldarwish</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Tools are pieces of software designed to help users complete specific tasks. Unlike apps, tools are usually designed to run on desktop computers and are often used for more complex tasks. For example, a web development tool might be used to create and edit webpages, while a photo editing tool might be used to manipulate images.</p><br><p class="article-text">Products</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/264507/pexels-photo-264507.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="architecture-building-business-city"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Products are pieces of software that are designed to provide a complete solution to a problem. Unlike apps and tools, products are usually designed to be used by businesses and organizations. For example, a customer relationship management (CRM) product might be used to manage customer data, while an enterprise resource planning (ERP) product might be used to manage a company’s finances.</p><br>
