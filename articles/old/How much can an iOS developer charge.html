                        <p class="article-text">As an iOS developer, you have the potential to make a great living. The amount you can charge for your services depends on a variety of factors, including your experience, the complexity of the project, and the size of the client.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">For starters, the amount you can charge as an iOS developer depends on your experience. If you’re just starting out, you may not be able to charge as much as someone who has been developing iOS apps for years. However, as you gain experience and build a portfolio of successful projects, you can increase your rates.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/54216/pexels-photo-54216.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-making-clay-pot-in-front-of-girl-during-daytime"><figcaption>picture by Shane Albuquerque</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The complexity of the project is also a factor in determining how much you can charge. If the project is simple and straightforward, you may not be able to charge as much as you would for a more complex project. On the other hand, if the project is complex and requires a lot of work, you can charge more.</p><br><p class="article-text">The size of the client is also important. If you’re working with a large company, you can usually charge more than if you’re working with a small business. This is because larger companies typically have larger budgets and can afford to pay more for quality work.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7388980/pexels-photo-7388980.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="cheerful-hairdresser-with-black-man"><figcaption>picture by John Diez</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Finally, the market rate for iOS developers also plays a role in determining how much you can charge. If the market rate is high, you can charge more for your services. On the other hand, if the market rate is low, you may need to lower your rates in order to remain competitive.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In general, experienced iOS developers can charge anywhere from $50 to $200 per hour, depending on the complexity of the project and the size of the client. However, this is just a rough estimate and the actual rate you can charge will depend on the factors mentioned above.</p><br>
