                        <p class="article-text">External GPU enclosures are becoming increasingly popular as a way to upgrade the performance of a laptop or desktop computer. But do they really work? The answer is yes, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">An external GPU enclosure is a device that allows you to connect a dedicated graphics card to your laptop or desktop computer. This can provide a significant boost in performance, allowing you to play games or do other graphics-intensive tasks that would otherwise be impossible.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6716692/pexels-photo-6716692.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="computer-components"><figcaption>picture by Jake Guzman</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first thing to consider when looking at an external GPU enclosure is the type of graphics card you want to use. Most enclosures are designed to work with specific types of graphics cards, so make sure you get one that is compatible with your card.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have the right enclosure, you will need to connect it to your computer. This is usually done via a USB or Thunderbolt connection. Depending on the type of connection you have, you may need to purchase an adapter.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4219861/pexels-photo-4219861.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="set-of-modern-port-adapters-on-black-surface"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the enclosure is connected, you will need to install the drivers for your graphics card. This is usually done through the manufacturer's website. Once the drivers are installed, you should be able to use the external GPU enclosure just like you would a regular graphics card.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It's important to note that external GPU enclosures are not a replacement for a dedicated graphics card. They are designed to provide a boost in performance, but they won't be able to match the performance of a dedicated card.</p><br>
