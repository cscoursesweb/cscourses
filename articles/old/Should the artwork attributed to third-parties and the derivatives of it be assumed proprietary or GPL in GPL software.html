It will explore the legal and ethical considerations of assuming proprietary or GPL rights to the artwork, and the potential consequences of doing so. It will also provide guidance on how to properly attribute artwork to GPL software, and the best practices for ensuring that the artwork is properly licensed. Finally, it will provide an overview of the various licenses available for artwork, and how they can be used in conjunction with GPL software.">

                        <p class="article-text">The question of whether artwork attributed to third-parties and the derivatives of it should be assumed proprietary or GPL in GPL software is a complex one. On the one hand, the GPL is a license that grants users the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute software, and artwork is often considered part of the software. On the other hand, artwork is often created by third-parties, and the copyright of the artwork may be held by the artist or another entity.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">In general, artwork that is attributed to third-parties and the derivatives of it should be assumed proprietary in GPL software. This is because the GPL does not grant users the right to use, modify, or redistribute artwork that is not owned by the software's copyright holder. The GPL only grants users the right to use, modify, and redistribute the software itself, not any artwork that is included with the software.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1089438/pexels-photo-1089438.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-matrix-background"><figcaption>picture by Markus Spiske</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">However, there are some exceptions to this rule. If the artwork is licensed under a compatible license, such as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, then it can be used, modified, and redistributed in GPL software. Additionally, if the artwork is in the public domain, then it can be used, modified, and redistributed in GPL software.</p><br>
