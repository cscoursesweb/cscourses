                        <p class="article-text">If your mobile carrier is upgrading their network, you may be wondering if you need to replace your phone. The answer to this question depends on a few factors, including the type of phone you have, the type of network your carrier is upgrading to, and the features you need from your phone.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you should determine the type of phone you have. If you have a newer phone, such as an iPhone or Android, then you may not need to replace it. These phones are designed to work with the latest network technologies, so they should be able to handle the upgrade. However, if you have an older phone, such as a flip phone or a feature phone, then you may need to replace it. These phones may not be able to handle the new network technology, so you may need to upgrade to a newer model.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/404280/pexels-photo-404280.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="turned-on-black-samsung-android-smartphone-displaying-clock-at-12-09"><figcaption>picture by Noah Erickson</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you should determine the type of network your carrier is upgrading to. If your carrier is upgrading to a 4G or 5G network, then you may need to replace your phone. These networks require newer phones that are capable of connecting to them. However, if your carrier is upgrading to a 3G network, then you may not need to replace your phone. Most phones are capable of connecting to 3G networks, so you should be able to keep your current phone.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you should consider the features you need from your phone. If you need access to the latest apps and features, then you may need to replace your phone. Newer phones are designed to take advantage of the latest technologies, so they may be better suited for your needs. However, if you donâ€™t need access to the latest apps and features, then you may not need to replace your phone.</p><br>
