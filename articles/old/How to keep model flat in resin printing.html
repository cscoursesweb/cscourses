                        <p class="article-text">3D printing has become increasingly popular in recent years, and resin printing is one of the most popular 3D printing methods. Resin printing is a great way to create detailed and accurate 3D models, but it can be tricky to keep the model flat during the printing process. Here are some tips on how to keep your model flat when resin printing.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">1. Use a Level Build Plate: The first step to keeping your model flat is to make sure your build plate is level. This is especially important when printing with resin, as the resin can easily pool and cause warping if the build plate is not level. To ensure your build plate is level, use a spirit level or other leveling tool to make sure the surface is even.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9035000/pexels-photo-9035000.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-a-person-pointing-at-start-written-on-a-paper"><figcaption>picture by RODNAE Productions</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">2. Use Supports: Supports are an essential part of resin printing, as they help to keep the model flat and prevent warping. When setting up your print, make sure to add supports to any areas that may be prone to warping, such as overhangs or thin walls. This will help to keep the model flat and prevent warping.</p><br><p class="article-text">3. Use a Heated Build Plate: A heated build plate can help to keep your model flat by preventing the resin from cooling too quickly. This will help to reduce warping and ensure that your model is printed accurately.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4793255/pexels-photo-4793255.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="hipster-sportsman-lifting-barbell-while-working-out-on-street"><figcaption>picture by Anete Lusina</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">4. Use a Resin with Low Shrinkage: Different types of resin have different levels of shrinkage, and some resins are more prone to warping than others. When choosing a resin for your print, make sure to select one with a low shrinkage rate to help keep your model flat.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">5. Use a Slower Print Speed: Printing at a slower speed can help to reduce warping, as it gives the resin more time to cool and solidify before the next layer is printed. This will help to keep your model flat and reduce the risk of warping.</p><br>
