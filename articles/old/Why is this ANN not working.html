                <title>Why is this ANN not working?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide an overview of why an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) may not be working as expected. We will discuss common issues that can arise when building and training an ANN, such as incorrect hyperparameter settings, insufficient data, and overfitting. We will also discuss potential solutions to these issues, such as adjusting the hyperparameters, collecting more data, and using regularization techniques. Finally, we will provide some tips for troubleshooting ANNs and ensuring that they are working properly.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), there are a variety of reasons why they may not be working as expected. In order to determine why an ANN is not working, it is important to first understand the basics of how ANNs work.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">An ANN is a type of machine learning algorithm that is modeled after the human brain. It is composed of a network of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are connected to each other in a specific way. Each neuron is responsible for processing a certain type of input and outputting a certain type of output. The neurons are connected to each other in a way that allows them to pass information from one neuron to another.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181671/pexels-photo-1181671.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="python-book"><figcaption>picture by Christina Morillo</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When an ANN is trained, it is given a set of inputs and outputs. The ANN then uses these inputs and outputs to learn how to process the data and produce the desired output. This process is known as training the ANN.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the ANN has been trained, it can then be used to make predictions or decisions based on the data it has been given. However, if the ANN is not working as expected, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4498154/pexels-photo-4498154.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-sportswoman-exercising-with-gymnastic-hula-hoop"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">1. The data used to train the ANN is not representative of the data it will be used on. This means that the ANN may not be able to accurately process the data it is given.</p><br><p class="article-text">2. The ANN has not been trained properly. This could be due to a lack of data, incorrect parameters, or incorrect training algorithms.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6154059/pexels-photo-6154059.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-off-white-dress-with-white-gloves-holding-a-pearl-necklace"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">3. The ANN is overfitting the data. This means that the ANN is too closely fitting the data it has been given, and is not able to generalize to new data.</p><br><p class="article-text">4. The ANN is underfitting the data. This means that the ANN is not able to accurately process the data it has been given.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6154059/pexels-photo-6154059.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-off-white-dress-with-white-gloves-holding-a-pearl-necklace"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">5. The ANN is not able to accurately process the data due to a lack of complexity. This could be due to a lack of layers, neurons, or other parameters.</p><br><p class="article-text">6. The ANN is not able to accurately process the data due to a lack of training. This could be due to a lack of data, incorrect parameters, or incorrect training algorithms.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6154059/pexels-photo-6154059.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-off-white-dress-with-white-gloves-holding-a-pearl-necklace"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the cause of the problem has been identified, it is important to take the necessary steps to fix the issue. This could include changing the data used to train the ANN, changing the parameters, or changing the training algorithms.</p><br>
