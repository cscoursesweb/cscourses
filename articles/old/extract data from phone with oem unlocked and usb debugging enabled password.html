                        <p class="article-text">Extracting data from a phone with OEM unlocked and USB debugging enabled password can be a tricky process. Depending on the type of phone, the process may vary. In this article, we will discuss the steps to extract data from a phone with OEM unlocked and USB debugging enabled password.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to connect the phone to the computer via a USB cable. Once the phone is connected, you will need to enable USB debugging on the phone. To do this, go to the Settings menu and select Developer Options. Then, enable USB debugging.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4219864/pexels-photo-4219864.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="silver-usb-cable"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once USB debugging is enabled, you will need to unlock the phone. To do this, you will need to enter the OEM unlock code. This code is usually provided by the manufacturer of the phone. Once the phone is unlocked, you can then access the data stored on the phone.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is to install a data extraction tool on the computer. There are many data extraction tools available, such as iMyFone D-Back, Dr.Fone, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. Once the tool is installed, you can then connect the phone to the computer and begin the data extraction process.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5087483/pexels-photo-5087483.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="the-porte-d-aval-rock-formation-in-etretat-france"><figcaption>picture by Max Avans</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The data extraction process will vary depending on the type of phone and the data extraction tool you are using. Generally, the process involves selecting the type of data you want to extract, such as contacts, messages, photos, videos, and more. Once the data is selected, the tool will begin to extract the data from the phone.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the data is extracted, you can then save it to your computer. Depending on the type of data, you may need to use a specific program to view the data. For example, if you are extracting photos, you may need to use an image viewer to view the photos.</p><br>
