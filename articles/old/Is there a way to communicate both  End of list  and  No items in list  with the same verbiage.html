                <title>Is there a way to communicate both "End of list" and "No items in list" with the same verbiage?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The answer to the question of whether it is possible to communicate both "End of list" and "No items in list" with the same verbiage is yes. In many cases, the same phrase can be used to indicate both the end of a list and the absence of items in a list. This can be done by using a phrase such as "No more items" or "No further items" to indicate that the list has come to an end, regardless of whether there are any items in the list or not. By using this type of phrase, it is possible to communicate both "End of list" and "No items in list" with the same verbiage.">
