                        <p class="article-text">WPF Application UI Freezing Despite Collection View Source Being Updated by a Background Worker</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">If you’re developing a WPF application and you’re experiencing UI freezing despite your collection view source being updated by a background worker, you’re not alone. This is a common issue that many developers face when working with WPF applications. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue and get your application running smoothly again.</p><br><p class="article-text">The first step is to understand why this issue is occurring. WPF applications use a concept called data binding to keep the UI in sync with the underlying data. When the data changes, the UI is automatically updated to reflect the new data. However, if the data is being updated by a background worker, the UI may not be able to keep up with the changes. This can cause the UI to freeze or become unresponsive.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is to identify the source of the issue. If the data is being updated by a background worker, it’s likely that the worker is not using the correct synchronization context. WPF applications require the use of a specific synchronization context in order to ensure that the UI is updated correctly. If the background worker is not using the correct synchronization context, the UI will not be updated correctly and the application will freeze.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/209255/pexels-photo-209255.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blur-brass-chrome-close-up"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you’ve identified the source of the issue, the next step is to resolve it. The easiest way to do this is to ensure that the background worker is using the correct synchronization context. This can be done by setting the SynchronizationContext property of the background worker to the DispatcherSynchronizationContext. This will ensure that the UI is updated correctly when the data is changed.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s important to ensure that the collection view source is being updated correctly. If the collection view source is not being updated correctly, the UI will not be updated correctly and the application will freeze. To ensure that the collection view source is being updated correctly, you should use the ObservableCollection class. This class provides a way to notify the UI when the underlying data has changed, ensuring that the UI is always up to date.</p><br>
