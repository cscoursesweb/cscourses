                        <p class="article-text">Using color gradients for lines in Keynote is a great way to add visual interest to your presentation. Color gradients can be used to create a sense of depth and movement, and can be used to draw attention to certain elements of your presentation.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The good news is that Keynote does offer the ability to use color gradients for lines. To do this, you will need to use the “Shape” tool. This tool can be found in the toolbar at the top of the Keynote window. Once you have selected the “Shape” tool, you can draw a line on the slide.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7115/iphone-speech-conference-cell-phone.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="three-person-sitting-on-chairs-while-crossed-legs"><figcaption>picture by Startup Stock Photos</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have drawn the line, you can then select the “Fill” option from the toolbar. This will open up a menu of options, including the ability to select a color gradient. You can then choose the type of gradient you would like to use, as well as the colors you would like to use.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have chosen the gradient and colors, you can then adjust the settings to get the exact look you are going for. You can adjust the angle of the gradient, the opacity, and the size of the gradient. You can also adjust the color of the gradient to get the exact look you are going for.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2877331/pexels-photo-2877331.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="taking-photo-of-a-man-playing-instrument"><figcaption>picture by Kyle Loftus</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you have adjusted the settings to your liking, you can then click “OK” to apply the gradient to the line. You can then move and resize the line as needed to get the exact look you are going for.</p><br>
