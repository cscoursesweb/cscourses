                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide an overview of the OpenSSL AES-GCM error 'bad decrypt' and explain why other block modes may work better. We will discuss the differences between AES-GCM and other block modes, the potential causes of the 'bad decrypt' error, and how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. We will also provide some tips for avoiding the error in the future. Finally, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using AES-GCM compared to other block modes.">

                        <p class="article-text">OpenSSL AES-GCM is a popular encryption algorithm used to secure data in transit. It is a block cipher mode of operation that combines the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). AES-GCM is a secure and efficient way to encrypt data, but it can sometimes produce an error message that says “bad decrypt”. This error can be caused by a variety of factors, and it is important to understand why it occurs and how to fix it.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most common cause of the “bad decrypt” error is an incorrect key. AES-GCM requires a unique key for each encryption operation, and if the wrong key is used, the data will not be able to be decrypted. It is important to ensure that the correct key is used for each encryption operation.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5699860/pexels-photo-5699860.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-in-desperate-and-anxiety-sitting-alone"><figcaption>picture by Alex Green</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another possible cause of the “bad decrypt” error is an incorrect initialization vector (IV). The IV is a random number used to ensure that the same plaintext does not produce the same ciphertext. If the wrong IV is used, the data will not be able to be decrypted. It is important to ensure that the correct IV is used for each encryption operation.</p><br><p class="article-text">The “bad decrypt” error can also be caused by a corrupted ciphertext. If the ciphertext is corrupted, the data will not be able to be decrypted. It is important to ensure that the ciphertext is not corrupted before attempting to decrypt it.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the “bad decrypt” error can be caused by an incorrect authentication tag. The authentication tag is used to ensure that the ciphertext has not been tampered with. If the wrong authentication tag is used, the data will not be able to be decrypted. It is important to ensure that the correct authentication tag is used for each encryption operation.</p><br>
