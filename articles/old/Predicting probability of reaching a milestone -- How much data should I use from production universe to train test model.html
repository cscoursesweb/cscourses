                <title>Predicting probability of reaching a milestone -- How much data should I use from production universe to train/test model?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="When it comes to predicting the probability of reaching a milestone, it is important to consider the amount of data needed to train and test a model. The amount of data needed will depend on the complexity of the model and the size of the production universe. Generally, the more data used, the more accurate the model will be. However, it is important to ensure that the data used is representative of the production universe. If the data used is not representative, the model may not accurately predict the probability of reaching the milestone. Additionally, it is important to consider the cost of collecting and storing the data. If the cost of collecting and storing the data is too high, it may not be feasible to use a large amount of data. Ultimately, the amount of data needed to train and test a model should be determined based on the complexity of the model, the size of the production universe, and the cost of collecting and storing the data.">

                        <p class="article-text">Predicting the probability of reaching a milestone is an important task for any business. It can help inform decisions about how to allocate resources, plan for future growth, and identify areas of potential risk. But how much data should you use from the production universe to train and test your model?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question depends on the type of data you are using and the complexity of the model you are building. Generally speaking, the more data you have, the better. However, it is important to consider the quality of the data as well as the quantity. If you have a large amount of data but it is of poor quality, it may not be useful for training and testing your model.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7567522/pexels-photo-7567522.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-in-white-long-sleeves-looking-at-the-screen"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When it comes to the amount of data you should use, it is important to consider the size of the production universe. If the production universe is large, you may need to use a larger sample size to ensure that your model is accurate. On the other hand, if the production universe is small, you may be able to get away with using a smaller sample size.</p><br><p class="article-text">It is also important to consider the complexity of the model you are building. If the model is complex, you may need to use more data to ensure that it is accurate. On the other hand, if the model is relatively simple, you may be able to get away with using a smaller sample size.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7876510/pexels-photo-7876510.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-woman-reading-newspaper"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to consider the type of data you are using. If you are using structured data, such as customer data or financial data, you may need to use a larger sample size to ensure accuracy. On the other hand, if you are using unstructured data, such as text or images, you may be able to get away with using a smaller sample size.</p><br>
