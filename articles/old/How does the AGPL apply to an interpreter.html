                <meta name="description" content="The Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a free software license that applies to any software that is distributed over a network. This includes interpreters, which are programs that interpret and execute instructions written in a programming language. The AGPL requires that any software distributed over a network must be made available to the public in source code form, and that any modifications to the software must also be made available in source code form. Additionally, the AGPL requires that any software distributed over a network must include a copy of the AGPL license. By adhering to the AGPL, interpreters can be distributed over a network while still protecting the rights of the software's authors.">

                        <p class="article-text">The AGPL, or Affero General Public License, is a type of open source software license that is designed to protect the rights of users of software that is distributed over a network. It is a type of copyleft license, meaning that it requires that any modifications or additions to the software must be released under the same license. This ensures that the software remains open source and freely available to all users.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When it comes to interpreters, the AGPL applies in much the same way as it does to other types of software. An interpreter is a type of computer program that takes source code written in a programming language and translates it into instructions that can be understood and executed by a computer. The AGPL applies to interpreters in that it requires that any modifications or additions to the interpreter must be released under the same license. This ensures that the interpreter remains open source and freely available to all users.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3345876/pexels-photo-3345876.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="shallow-focus-photo-of-white-open-sigange"><figcaption>picture by Tim Mossholder</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The AGPL also applies to interpreters in that it requires that any modifications or additions to the interpreter must be made available to the public. This means that any changes or additions to the interpreter must be made available to the public in a manner that allows them to access and use the modified version of the interpreter. This ensures that the interpreter remains open source and freely available to all users.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the AGPL also applies to interpreters in that it requires that any modifications or additions to the interpreter must be made available to the public in a manner that allows them to modify and redistribute the modified version of the interpreter. This ensures that the interpreter remains open source and freely available to all users.</p><br>
