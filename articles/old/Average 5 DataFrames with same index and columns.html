                        <p class="article-text">When working with data, it is often necessary to combine multiple dataframes into one. This can be done in a variety of ways, but one of the most common methods is to average the dataframes with the same index and columns. This article will explain how to average five dataframes with the same index and columns.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to create the five dataframes. This can be done by importing the data from a file or by manually entering the data into the dataframes. Once the dataframes have been created, they should be checked to make sure that they have the same index and columns. If the dataframes do not have the same index and columns, they cannot be averaged.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the dataframes have been checked, the next step is to create a new dataframe that will contain the average of the five dataframes. This can be done by using the pandas library in Python. The pandas library has a function called “DataFrame.mean()” which can be used to calculate the average of the dataframes. The function takes in the dataframes as parameters and returns a new dataframe with the average of the dataframes.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the new dataframe has been created, it can be used to analyze the data. For example, the average of the dataframes can be used to identify trends or patterns in the data. Additionally, the data can be used to compare the performance of different dataframes.</p><br>
