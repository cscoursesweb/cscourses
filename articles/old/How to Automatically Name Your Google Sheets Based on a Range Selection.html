                        <p class="article-text">Google Sheets is a powerful spreadsheet application that allows users to create and manage data in an organized and efficient manner. One of the most useful features of Google Sheets is the ability to name sheets based on values selected from a range. This feature can be used to quickly and easily organize data into separate sheets based on specific criteria.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Naming sheets based on values selected from a range is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps. The first step is to create a range of values that will be used to name the sheets. This can be done by entering the values into a column or row of cells. Once the range of values has been created, the next step is to select the range of cells. This can be done by clicking and dragging the mouse over the range of cells.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8947778/pexels-photo-8947778.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="empty-white-paper-sheets-on-a-black-chair"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the range of cells has been selected, the next step is to open the “Data” menu and select the “Named Ranges” option. This will open a dialog box that will allow the user to name the range of cells. The user should enter a name for the range of cells and then click “OK”.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The final step is to select the “Sheets” menu and select the “Name Sheet Based on Range” option. This will open a dialog box that will allow the user to select the range of cells that was previously named. Once the range of cells has been selected, the user should click “OK” and the sheets will be named based on the values selected from the range.</p><br>
