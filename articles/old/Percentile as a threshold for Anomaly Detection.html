                <meta name="description" content="Anomaly detection is an important tool for identifying outliers in data sets. One of the most commonly used methods for anomaly detection is percentile-based thresholding. This method uses a percentile value as a threshold to identify outliers in a data set. In this article, we will discuss how percentile-based thresholding works and how it can be used for anomaly detection. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using percentile-based thresholding for anomaly detection. Finally, we will provide some tips for using percentile-based thresholding for anomaly detection.">

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Anomaly detection is a process of identifying unusual patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. It is used in a variety of applications, such as fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and medical diagnosis. One of the most common methods of anomaly detection is percentile-based thresholding.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Percentile-based thresholding is a method of anomaly detection that uses percentile values to determine whether a data point is an outlier or not. It works by calculating the percentile of a given data point and then comparing it to a predetermined threshold. If the data point is above the threshold, it is considered an outlier.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7425340/pexels-photo-7425340.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="manual-red-fire-alarm-system"><figcaption>picture by Nothing Ahead</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The percentile threshold is typically set at a value that is higher than the average value of the data set. This ensures that only the most extreme values are considered outliers. For example, if the average value of a data set is 10, then a percentile threshold of 95% would mean that any data point above 19 would be considered an outlier.</p><br><p class="article-text">The advantage of percentile-based thresholding is that it is relatively simple to implement and can be used to detect outliers in a wide variety of data sets. It is also relatively easy to adjust the threshold value to account for different data sets.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14096635/pexels-photo-14096635.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="hapishane"><figcaption>picture by ZAMANSIZ FOTOGRAFCI</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">The main disadvantage of percentile-based thresholding is that it can be prone to false positives. This is because the threshold value is set based on the average value of the data set, which may not accurately reflect the true distribution of the data. As a result, some data points that are not actually outliers may be incorrectly identified as such.</p><br>
