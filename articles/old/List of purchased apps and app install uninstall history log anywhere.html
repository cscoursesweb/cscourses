                        <p class="article-text">The question of where to find a list of purchased apps and app install/uninstall history log is a common one for many smartphone users. With the ever-growing number of apps available, it can be difficult to keep track of which apps you have purchased and when you have installed or uninstalled them. Fortunately, there are a few ways to access this information.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first place to look is in the app store itself. Most app stores, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, will keep a record of all the apps you have purchased. This list can be accessed by logging into your account and navigating to the “My Apps” section. Here, you will be able to view a list of all the apps you have purchased, as well as the date of purchase.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/147413/twitter-facebook-together-exchange-of-information-147413.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="facebook-application-icon"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another way to access your app install/uninstall history is through your device’s settings. On an iPhone, you can access this information by going to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage. Here, you will be able to view a list of all the apps installed on your device, as well as the date of installation and uninstallation.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you are an Android user, you can access your app install/uninstall history by going to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info. Here, you will be able to view a list of all the apps installed on your device, as well as the date of installation and uninstallation.</p><br>
