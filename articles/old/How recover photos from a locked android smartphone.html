                        <p class="article-text">Recovering photos from a locked Android smartphone can be a tricky process, but it is possible. Whether you have forgotten your password, or your phone has been locked due to a security breach, there are a few methods you can use to get your photos back.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to try and unlock your phone. If you have forgotten your password, you can try using your Google account to reset it. You can also try using your device’s “Find My Device” feature, which can help you reset your password. If these methods don’t work, you may need to use a third-party unlocking tool.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12640804/pexels-photo-12640804.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="models-with-toy-phone"><figcaption>picture by AlteredSnaps</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you are unable to unlock your phone, you can still recover your photos. The best way to do this is to use a data recovery tool. These tools are designed to scan your device and recover any lost or deleted data, including photos. There are a number of data recovery tools available, both free and paid. It is important to choose a reliable tool, as some may contain malware or other malicious software.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have chosen a data recovery tool, you will need to connect your device to your computer. You may need to enable USB debugging on your device, which can be done by going to the “Developer Options” menu in your device’s settings. Once your device is connected, you can run the data recovery tool and it will scan your device for any recoverable data.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6347955/pexels-photo-6347955.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-employee-working-on-laptop-with-photo-on-screen-indoors"><figcaption>picture by Liza Summer</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the scan is complete, you will be able to view a list of all the recoverable data, including photos. You can then select the photos you want to recover and save them to your computer.</p><br>
