                        <p class="article-text">Torifying an arbitrary application is a process of making an application use the Tor network to protect the user's privacy and anonymity. It is a way of routing the application's traffic through the Tor network, which is a network of volunteer-run servers that help to anonymize internet traffic.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The process of Torifying an application is relatively simple and can be done in a few steps. The first step is to install the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a package of software that includes the Tor client, the Tor Browser, and other related tools. Once the Tor Browser Bundle is installed, the user can then configure the application to use the Tor network.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12944970/pexels-photo-12944970.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="business-signage-over-a-granite-top-table"><figcaption>picture by Oleksandr Pidvalnyi</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to configure the application to use the Tor network. This can be done by setting the application's proxy settings to use the Tor network. This can be done by entering the Tor network's IP address and port number into the application's proxy settings. Once the proxy settings are configured, the application will then be able to route its traffic through the Tor network.</p><br><p class="article-text">The last step is to test the application to make sure that it is using the Tor network correctly. This can be done by using a tool such as TorCheck, which will check to see if the application is routing its traffic through the Tor network. If the application is not routing its traffic through the Tor network, then the user will need to adjust the proxy settings or try a different Tor network.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the application is successfully Torified, the user can then enjoy the benefits of using the Tor network. This includes increased privacy and anonymity, as well as access to websites and services that may be blocked in the user's country.</p><br>
