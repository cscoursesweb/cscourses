                <meta name="description" content="The Apple M1 Pro is a powerful processor that can be used to run virtual machines on Linux. In this article, we will discuss whether it is possible to use GPU hardware acceleration in a Linux virtual machine (VM) via the Apple Virtualization framework. We will look at the features of the M1 Pro, the types of GPU hardware acceleration available, and the steps needed to enable GPU acceleration in a Linux VM. Finally, we will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using GPU hardware acceleration in a Linux VM on the M1 Pro.">
