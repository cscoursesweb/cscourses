                <meta name="description" content="GridSearchCrossValidation score and score on testset are two different metrics used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. GridSearchCrossValidation score is the average accuracy of the model on the training set after performing cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data. It involves splitting the training set into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset. The average accuracy of the model on the training set is then calculated. 

Score on testset is the accuracy of the model on the test set. The test set is a set of data that the model has not seen before. It is used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data. The accuracy of the model on the test set is a better indicator of the model’s performance on unseen data than the accuracy on the training set.">

        <p class="article-text">GSCV is a type of hyperparameter optimization technique that is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It works by training the model on a subset of the data using different combinations of hyperparameters and then evaluating the model’s performance on a validation set. The combination of hyperparameters that produces the best performance on the validation set is then used to train the model on the entire dataset.</p><br><p class="article-text">The score on the testset is a measure of how well the model performs on unseen data.
