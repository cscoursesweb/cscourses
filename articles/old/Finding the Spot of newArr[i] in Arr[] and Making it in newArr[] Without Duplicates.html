                        <p class="article-text">Finding the spot of newArr[i] in Arr[] and making this spot in newArr[] (newArr[arr[j] = newArr[i]) without duplicates can be a tricky task. Fortunately, there are a few methods that can be used to accomplish this. In this article, we will discuss how to find the spot of newArr[i] in Arr[] and make this spot in newArr[] (newArr[arr[j] = newArr[i]) without duplicates.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first method is to use a loop. This method involves looping through the Arr[] array and checking each element to see if it matches the value of newArr[i]. If a match is found, the index of the element in Arr[] is stored in a variable. This variable is then used to set the value of newArr[arr[j]] to newArr[i]. This method is simple and straightforward, but it can be time consuming if the Arr[] array is large.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/206409/pexels-photo-206409.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="casual-cute-female-friends"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second method is to use a hash table. This method involves creating a hash table with the values of Arr[] as the keys and the indices of the elements in Arr[] as the values. Then, the value of newArr[i] is used to look up the index in the hash table. This index is then used to set the value of newArr[arr[j]] to newArr[i]. This method is more efficient than the loop method, as it only requires one lookup in the hash table.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third method is to use a binary search. This method involves sorting the Arr[] array and then using a binary search to find the index of the element that matches the value of newArr[i]. This index is then used to set the value of newArr[arr[j]] to newArr[i]. This method is more efficient than the loop and hash table methods, as it only requires one lookup in the sorted array.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3768894/pexels-photo-3768894.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="ethnic-young-woman-using-laptop-while-having-tasty-beverage-in-modern-street-cafe"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fourth method is to use a set. This method involves creating a set with the values of Arr[] as the elements. Then, the value of newArr[i] is used to look up the index in the set. This index is then used to set the value of newArr[arr[j]] to newArr[i]. This method is the most efficient of the four methods, as it only requires one lookup in the set.</p><br>
