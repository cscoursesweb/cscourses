                <title>Does sklearn perform feature selection within cross validation?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Sklearn is a powerful machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for data analysis and predictive modeling. One of the features of sklearn is its ability to perform feature selection within cross validation. Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to use in a model. Cross validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting the data into training and testing sets. By performing feature selection within cross validation, sklearn can identify the most important features for a given model and ensure that the model is not overfitting the data. This can help improve the accuracy and reliability of the model.">

        <p class="article-text">The short answer is yes, sklearn does perform feature selection within cross validation. Cross validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on unseen data. It is a popular method for assessing the accuracy of a model and is often used in combination with feature selection. Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to use in a model.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14656493/pexels-photo-14656493.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="people-hanging-out-beside-a-church-building"><figcaption>picture by Geancarlo Peruzzolo</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In sklearn, feature selection is performed within cross validation using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm. RFE is a feature selection algorithm that works by recursively removing features from the dataset until the desired number of features is reached. The algorithm works by first fitting a model to the dataset and then evaluating the importance of each feature. The least important features are then removed from the dataset and the model is re-fit. This process is repeated until the desired number of features is reached.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The advantage of using RFE within cross validation is that it allows for the selection of the most relevant features while also evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data. This ensures that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize to unseen data.</p><br>
