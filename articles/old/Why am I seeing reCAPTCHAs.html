                <meta name="description" content="ReCAPTCHAs are a type of security measure used to protect websites from malicious bots and automated programs. They are used to verify that a human is accessing the website, rather than a computer program. ReCAPTCHAs are typically triggered when a website detects suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts or a large number of requests from the same IP address. By requiring users to complete a ReCAPTCHA, websites can ensure that only legitimate users are accessing their content.">
