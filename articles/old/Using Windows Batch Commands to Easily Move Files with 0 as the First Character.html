                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Windows batch commands are a powerful tool for automating tasks on your computer. They can be used to perform a variety of tasks, from copying files to running programs. One of the most useful batch commands is the move command, which allows you to move files from one location to another. In this article, we will discuss how to use the move command to move all the files with 0 as the first character to a dedicated folder.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to open the command prompt. To do this, press the Windows key + R, type “cmd” and press enter. This will open the command prompt window.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3769979/pexels-photo-3769979.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="key-with-trinket-in-shabby-door"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the command prompt window is open, you can use the move command to move all the files with 0 as the first character to a dedicated folder. To do this, type the following command:</p><br><p class="article-text">move /-y “C:\*0*.*” “C:\MyFolder\”</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/590011/pexels-photo-590011.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-printer-paper"><figcaption>picture by Lukas</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">This command will move all the files with 0 as the first character from the root directory (C:\) to the folder “MyFolder”. The “/y” switch is used to suppress any confirmation prompts.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you want to move all the files with 0 as the first character from a specific folder, you can use the following command:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12467779/pexels-photo-12467779.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="british-flags-on-line-in-town"><figcaption>picture by Mathias Reding</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">move /-y “C:\MyFolder\*0*.*” “C:\MyFolder\MyFolder2\”</p><br><p class="article-text">This command will move all the files with 0 as the first character from the folder “MyFolder” to the folder “MyFolder2”.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6718540/pexels-photo-6718540.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="men-in-british-military-costumes-sitting-by-the-table"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">You can also use wildcards to move all the files with 0 as the first character from multiple folders. For example, the following command will move all the files with 0 as the first character from the folders “MyFolder1”, “MyFolder2” and “MyFolder3” to the folder “MyFolder4”:</p><br><p class="article-text">move /-y “C:\MyFolder1\*0*.*” “C:\MyFolder2\*0*.*” “C:\MyFolder3\*0*.*” “C:\MyFolder4\”</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">These are just a few examples of how to use the move command to move all the files with 0 as the first character to a dedicated folder. You can use the same command with different parameters to move files from different locations.</p><br>
