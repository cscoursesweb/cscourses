                <meta name="description" content="A Keras model does not require stemming or lemmatization steps because it is a deep learning model that is able to learn the context of words without the need for these pre-processing steps. Stemming and lemmatization are used to reduce words to their root form, which can help reduce the size of the vocabulary and improve the accuracy of the model. However, deep learning models are able to learn the context of words without the need for these pre-processing steps, making them more efficient and accurate.">

                        <p class="article-text">Keras is a powerful open-source deep learning library written in Python. It is used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production. Keras models are used for a variety of tasks, including natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, stemming and lemmatization are two important pre-processing steps that are used to reduce the complexity of a text by normalizing words to their base forms.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Stemming and lemmatization are important steps in NLP because they help reduce the complexity of a text by normalizing words to their base forms. For example, the words “run”, “running”, and “ran” all have the same stem, “run”. Similarly, the words “am”, “are”, and “is” all have the same lemma, “be”. Stemming and lemmatization are important because they help reduce the size of the vocabulary that a model needs to learn, which can improve the accuracy of the model.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8450447/pexels-photo-8450447.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-person-holding-purple-flower-with-green-stem"><figcaption>picture by MART  PRODUCTION</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">So why does a Keras model skip the stemming and lemmatization steps? The answer is that Keras models are designed to be fast and efficient. Stemming and lemmatization are time-consuming processes that can slow down the training process. Furthermore, Keras models are designed to work with raw text, so they don’t need to be pre-processed.</p><br><p class="article-text">Keras models are also designed to be flexible. They can be used for a variety of tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Stemming and lemmatization are not always necessary for these tasks, so Keras models can skip these steps if they are not needed.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/35987/pexels-photo.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-wearing-black-sports-bra-reaching-floor-while-standing"><figcaption>picture by Roman Davayposmotrim</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, Keras models are designed to be easy to use. Stemming and lemmatization can be difficult to implement, so Keras models can skip these steps to make the model easier to use.</p><br>
