                        <p class="article-text">If you’re running code in a Qiskit Jupyter notebook and you’re seeing multiple X gates show up, it can be a bit of a nuisance. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to get rid of them.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, it’s important to understand why the X gates are appearing in the first place. X gates are used to flip the state of a qubit from 0 to 1 or vice versa. In some cases, the X gates may be necessary for the code to run correctly. However, if the X gates are appearing multiple times, it could be an indication that the code is not optimized.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12625258/pexels-photo-12625258.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="entrance-gates-inside-ferry-terminal"><figcaption>picture by Mathias Reding</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first step to getting rid of the X gates is to optimize the code. This can be done by using the Qiskit transpiler, which is a tool that can optimize the code for better performance. The transpiler can help reduce the number of X gates by combining them into a single gate.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another way to reduce the number of X gates is to use the Qiskit compiler. The compiler can help optimize the code by removing redundant gates and combining multiple gates into a single gate. This can help reduce the number of X gates and improve the performance of the code.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7014457/pexels-photo-7014457.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-woman-creating-photography-collage-on-paper-sheet"><figcaption>picture by George Milton</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if the code is still producing multiple X gates, it may be necessary to manually remove them. This can be done by going through the code and removing any unnecessary X gates. This can be a tedious process, but it can help reduce the number of X gates and improve the performance of the code.</p><br>
