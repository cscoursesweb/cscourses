                        <p class="article-text">If you are experiencing run-time error 53 every time you open a file in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Big Sur, you are not alone. This is a common issue that many users have encountered when using the latest version of the Mac operating system. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to try and fix this issue.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to make sure that you have the latest version of Microsoft Office installed on your Mac. If you are using an older version, it may not be compatible with Big Sur and could be causing the run-time error 53. To check which version of Office you have installed, open any Office application and click on the “Help” menu. You should see the version number listed there. If you need to update your Office version, you can do so by visiting the Microsoft website.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4449620/pexels-photo-4449620.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-brown-rock-formation-on-seashore"><figcaption>picture by Vlada Karpovich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to check your Mac’s system preferences. Go to the “Security & Privacy” section and make sure that the “Allow apps downloaded from” option is set to “App Store and identified developers”. This will ensure that your Mac is allowing the Office applications to run properly.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you are still experiencing run-time error 53, you may need to reset your Mac’s permissions. To do this, open the “Terminal” application and type in the following command: “sudo chmod -R 755 /Applications/Microsoft\ Office/”. This will reset the permissions for the Office applications and should help to fix the issue.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3747132/pexels-photo-3747132.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-smartphone-on-table"><figcaption>picture by Polina Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you are still having trouble, you may need to reinstall the Office applications. To do this, open the “App Store” and search for “Microsoft Office”. Select the version you want to install and follow the on-screen instructions. Once the installation is complete, try opening a file in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint and see if the run-time error 53 is still occurring.</p><br>
