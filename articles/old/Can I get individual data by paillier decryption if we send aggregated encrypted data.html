                <title>Can I get individual data by paillier decryption if we send aggregated encrypted data?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The Paillier cryptosystem is a powerful tool for encrypting and decrypting data. It is a public-key cryptosystem that allows for the encryption of individual data as well as the aggregation of encrypted data. This means that it is possible to send aggregated encrypted data and then decrypt it to get individual data. This is a useful feature for applications such as secure voting systems, where individual votes need to be kept private while still allowing for the aggregation of the votes. In this article, we will discuss how the Paillier cryptosystem works and how it can be used to get individual data from aggregated encrypted data.">

                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether you can get individual data by Paillier decryption if you send aggregated encrypted data is yes. Paillier encryption is a type of public-key cryptography that allows for the secure transmission of data. It is a form of homomorphic encryption, meaning that it allows for the encryption of data and the decryption of the same data without the need for the original data to be present.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Paillier encryption is a form of additive homomorphic encryption, meaning that it allows for the addition of encrypted data without the need for the original data to be present. This makes it ideal for the transmission of aggregated data, as the data can be encrypted and then sent without the need for the original data to be present.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4197988/pexels-photo-4197988.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="chicken-cubes-on-white-table"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the aggregated data is received, it can then be decrypted using the Paillier decryption algorithm. This algorithm allows for the decryption of the aggregated data, and the individual data can then be extracted from the decrypted data. This means that individual data can be obtained from the aggregated encrypted data, without the need for the original data to be present.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The use of Paillier encryption for the transmission of aggregated data is becoming increasingly popular, as it allows for the secure transmission of data without the need for the original data to be present. This makes it ideal for applications such as online voting, where the individual votes can be encrypted and then sent without the need for the original data to be present.</p><br>
