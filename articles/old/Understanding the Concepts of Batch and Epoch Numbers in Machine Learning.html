                        <p class="article-text">The concept behind batch number and epoch number is an important one to understand when it comes to machine learning. Batch number and epoch number are two terms used to describe the process of training a machine learning model. In this article, we will discuss what batch number and epoch number are, how they are used, and why they are important.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Batch number is a term used to describe the number of data points that are used to train a machine learning model. A batch is a subset of the entire dataset that is used to train the model. The batch size is typically determined by the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. For example, if the dataset is large and complex, then a larger batch size may be used. On the other hand, if the dataset is small and simple, then a smaller batch size may be used.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4226882/pexels-photo-4226882.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="scattered-various-seashells-on-beige-background"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Epoch number is a term used to describe the number of times the model is trained on the same batch of data. An epoch is a single iteration of the training process. During each epoch, the model is trained on the same batch of data. The number of epochs is typically determined by the complexity of the model and the desired accuracy of the model. For example, if the model is complex and the desired accuracy is high, then more epochs may be used.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The concept behind batch number and epoch number is important because it helps to determine the accuracy of the model. By using a larger batch size and more epochs, the model can be trained more accurately. On the other hand, if the batch size is too small or the number of epochs is too low, then the model may not be able to learn the data as accurately.</p><br>
