                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">It’s been over a decade since the concept of a dark theme was first introduced, and yet we still don’t have a universal dark theme available across all platforms. So, when will we finally have the dark theme?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question is complicated, as there are a number of factors that need to be taken into consideration. First and foremost, the development of a dark theme requires a significant amount of time and resources. This means that developers need to be willing to invest in the development of a dark theme, and this is something that is not always easy to come by.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/574071/pexels-photo-574071.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-encoding-in-laptop"><figcaption>picture by Lukas</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In addition, the development of a dark theme requires a certain level of technical expertise. This means that developers need to be familiar with the various coding languages and technologies that are necessary to create a dark theme. This can be a difficult task, as there are a number of different coding languages and technologies that need to be mastered in order to create a dark theme.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the development of a dark theme also requires a certain level of user acceptance. This means that users need to be willing to accept the dark theme and use it on a regular basis. This can be difficult to achieve, as users may be hesitant to switch to a dark theme if they are used to the traditional light theme.</p><br>
