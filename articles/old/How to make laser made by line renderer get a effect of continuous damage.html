                <meta name="description" content="If you're looking to create a continuous damage effect with a laser made by a line renderer, then this article is for you! We'll walk you through the steps of setting up a line renderer to create a laser with a continuous damage effect. First, you'll need to set up the line renderer with the appropriate parameters. Then, you'll need to create a script that will update the line renderer's parameters to create the desired effect. Finally, you'll need to adjust the laser's parameters to achieve the desired effect. With these steps, you'll be able to create a laser with a continuous damage effect.">

                        <p class="article-text">Laser made by line renderer is a popular tool used in video games and other interactive media. It can be used to create a variety of effects, from simple laser beams to complex 3D shapes. However, one of the most difficult effects to achieve with line renderer is the effect of continuous damage. This effect is often used in games to simulate the effects of a laser beam that is constantly damaging an object or character.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Fortunately, there are a few techniques that can be used to create this effect with line renderer. The first technique is to use a combination of line renderer and particle systems. By combining the two, you can create a continuous laser beam that will damage an object or character over time. This technique is often used in games to simulate the effects of a laser beam that is constantly damaging an object or character.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4767064/pexels-photo-4767064.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="brown-wooden-plank-in-close-up-photography"><figcaption>picture by Uzunov Rostislav</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second technique is to use a combination of line renderer and a shader.

By combining the two, you can create a continuous laser beam that will damage an object or character over time. This technique is often used in games to simulate the effects of a laser beam that is constantly damaging an object or character.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">No matter which technique you choose to use, the key to creating a continuous laser beam effect with line renderer is to make sure that the laser beam is constantly damaging the object or character. This can be done by adjusting the intensity of the laser beam, the speed of the laser beam, or the size of the laser beam. Additionally, you can also adjust the color of the laser beam to create a more realistic effect.</p><br>
