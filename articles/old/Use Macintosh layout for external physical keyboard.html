        <p class="article-text">If you’re a Mac user, you may have noticed that the layout of the keys on your keyboard is slightly different from the layout of a standard Windows keyboard. This is because Apple uses a different layout for its keyboards, known as the Macintosh layout. But what if you want to use an external physical keyboard with your Mac? Is it possible to use a Macintosh layout for an external physical keyboard?</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4050315/pexels-photo-4050315.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="young-lady-typing-on-keyboard-of-laptop-in-living-room"><figcaption>picture by Vlada Karpovich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The answer is yes, it is possible to use a Macintosh layout for an external physical keyboard. There are a few different ways to do this. The first is to purchase a keyboard that is specifically designed for Macs. These keyboards will have the same layout as the one on your Mac, so you won’t have to worry about any confusion when typing.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another option is to purchase a standard Windows keyboard and then use a keyboard mapping software to remap the keys to the Macintosh layout. This is a bit more complicated, but it can be done. You’ll need to find a software that is compatible with your Mac and then follow the instructions to remap the keys.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7411982/pexels-photo-7411982.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="world-map-on-wall-and-laptop-near-cup-and-container"><figcaption>picture by Monstera</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can purchase a keyboard that is designed to be used with both Macs and PCs. These keyboards will have both the Windows and Macintosh layouts printed on the keys, so you can easily switch between the two. This is a great option if you use both Macs and PCs and don’t want to have to purchase two separate keyboards.</p><br>
