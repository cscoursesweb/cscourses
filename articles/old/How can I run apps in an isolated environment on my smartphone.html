First, you should make sure you have the latest version of your operating system installed. This will help protect your device from any potential security threats. Additionally, you should consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to create a secure connection between your device and the internet. Finally, you can use a mobile security app to create an isolated environment for your apps. This will help protect your device from malicious software and keep your data safe. With these steps, you can ensure your apps are running in an isolated environment on your smartphone.">
