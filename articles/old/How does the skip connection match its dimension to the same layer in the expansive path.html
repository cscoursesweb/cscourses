                <meta name="description" content="Skip connections are a type of neural network architecture that allow for the transfer of information between two layers of a network. This is done by connecting the output of one layer to the input of another layer, allowing the network to “skip” over layers that may not be necessary for the task at hand. The skip connection is able to match its dimension to the same layer in the expansive path by using a linear transformation to adjust the size of the input to match the size of the output. This allows the network to pass information between layers of different sizes, allowing for more efficient and effective training.">

                        <p class="article-text">Skip connections are a type of connection used in deep neural networks that allow information to be passed from one layer to another without having to go through all the layers in between. This type of connection is used to improve the accuracy of the network by allowing the network to learn more complex patterns.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The skip connection works by connecting two layers of the same size. This means that the input and output of the two layers must have the same number of neurons. This allows the network to pass information from one layer to the next without having to go through all the layers in between.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9599917/pexels-photo-9599917.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="top-view-of-a-neuron-sculpture-in-the-lawn"><figcaption>picture by Giant Asparagus</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The skip connection is particularly useful when the network is very deep. This is because the deeper the network, the more layers there are between the input and output layers. By using skip connections, the network can pass information from one layer to the next without having to go through all the layers in between. This reduces the amount of time it takes for the network to learn a pattern and increases the accuracy of the network.</p><br><p class="article-text">The skip connection also helps to reduce the amount of parameters in the network. This is because the skip connection does not require any additional parameters to be added to the network. This helps to reduce the amount of time it takes for the network to learn a pattern and also helps to reduce the amount of memory required to store the parameters.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In order for the skip connection to match its dimension to the same layer in the expansive path, the input and output of the two layers must have the same number of neurons. This means that the number of neurons in the input layer must be the same as the number of neurons in the output layer. This ensures that the information can be passed from one layer to the next without having to go through all the layers in between.</p><br>
