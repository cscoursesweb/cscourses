                <title>If Samsung S10+ has max SD Card size 512GB, can I use USB OTG hub with 1TB card?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The Samsung S10+ has a maximum SD card size of 512GB, but you can still use a USB OTG hub with a 1TB card. USB OTG (On-The-Go) hubs are a great way to expand the storage capacity of your device, allowing you to connect external storage devices such as USB flash drives, hard drives, and SD cards. With a USB OTG hub, you can connect a 1TB card to your Samsung S10+ and access the extra storage space. However, it is important to note that the maximum size of the SD card that can be used with the Samsung S10+ is still limited to 512GB.">

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">If you’re a Samsung S10+ user, you may be wondering if you can use a USB OTG hub with a 1TB card. The answer is yes, you can. However, there are a few things to consider before you do so.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, the Samsung S10+ has a maximum SD card size of 512GB. This means that if you use a USB OTG hub with a 1TB card, the device will only be able to read and write data up to 512GB. This means that any data stored on the 1TB card beyond the 512GB limit will not be accessible.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, the USB OTG hub must be compatible with the Samsung S10+. Not all USB OTG hubs are compatible with the device, so it’s important to check the compatibility before purchasing one.</p><br><p class="article-text">Third, the USB OTG hub must be able to support the 1TB card. Some USB OTG hubs are only able to support cards up to a certain size, so it’s important to check the specifications of the hub before purchasing one.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12822514/pexels-photo-12822514.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="nature-summer-forest-garden"><figcaption>picture by Erik Karits</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s important to note that the Samsung S10+ does not support USB 3.0. This means that if you use a USB OTG hub with a 1TB card, the data transfer speeds will be slower than if you were using a USB 3.0 compatible device.</p><br>
