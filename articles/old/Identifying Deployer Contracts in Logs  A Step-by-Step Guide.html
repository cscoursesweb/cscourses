                        <p class="article-text">Identifying contracts created using deployer contracts from the logs can be a tricky task, but it is possible with the right tools and techniques. Deployer contracts are a type of smart contract that allow users to deploy other contracts on the blockchain. They are used to deploy a variety of different contracts, such as token contracts, voting contracts, and more.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in identifying contracts created using deployer contracts is to look at the logs. Logs are a record of all the transactions that have taken place on the blockchain. They can be used to track the creation of contracts, as well as the interactions between them. By looking at the logs, you can see which contracts were created and when.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3771097/pexels-photo-3771097.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="crop-businessman-signing-contract-in-office"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have identified the contracts that were created, you can then look for the deployer contract that was used to create them. Deployer contracts are typically identified by their address, which is a unique identifier that is assigned to each contract. You can use this address to look up the contract on the blockchain and see what type of contract it is.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have identified the deployer contract, you can then look at the code of the contract to see how it works. Deployer contracts typically have a set of functions that allow them to deploy other contracts. By looking at the code, you can see how the deployer contract works and how it is used to deploy other contracts.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7979463/pexels-photo-7979463.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="couple-holding-each-others-hands-while-talking-to-the-woman-sitting-in-front-of-them"><figcaption>picture by Kindel Media</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can look at the logs to see how the deployer contract was used to deploy other contracts. This will give you a better understanding of how the deployer contract works and how it is used to deploy other contracts.</p><br>
