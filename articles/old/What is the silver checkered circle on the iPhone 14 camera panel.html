                <title>What is the silver checkered circle on the iPhone 14 camera panel?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The iPhone 14 has a unique design feature that has caught the attention of many users: a silver checkered circle on the camera panel. This circle is actually a lens cover that helps protect the camera lens from dust, dirt, and scratches. It also helps reduce glare and reflections when taking photos in bright light. Additionally, the checkered pattern helps to reduce the amount of light that enters the lens, resulting in sharper images. The silver checkered circle is a great addition to the iPhone 14, providing users with an extra layer of protection for their camera lens.">

        <p class="article-text">Apple ProRAW is a new image format that combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of a RAW image with the convenience of Apple’s computational photography features. It allows users to take advantage of the powerful image processing capabilities of the iPhone while still having the ability to make adjustments to the image in post-processing.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1779487/pexels-photo-1779487.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="silver-imac-displaying-collage-photos"><figcaption>picture by Designecologist</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The silver checkered circle on the iPhone 14 camera panel is the visual representation of the Apple ProRAW feature. It is a reminder to users that they can take advantage of this powerful image format.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">When taking a photo in Apple ProRAW, the iPhone 14 will capture a RAW image and then apply Apple’s computational photography features to it. This means that the image will have the same level of detail and dynamic range as a RAW image, but with the added benefit of Apple’s image processing algorithms.</p><br>
