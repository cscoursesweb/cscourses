                        <p class="article-text">The “Old New Thing” links are a set of links to resources related to the Windows operating system. These links are important for developers and system administrators who need to access information about the Windows platform. The question of whether a bulk fix is possible for these links is an important one, as it could save time and effort for those who need to access the resources.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The short answer is that a bulk fix is not possible for the “Old New Thing” links. This is because the links are not stored in a single location, but rather are scattered across multiple websites and resources. As such, it would be difficult to make a single change that would affect all of the links.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/13185339/pexels-photo-13185339.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="arthur-ravenel-jr-bridge-sunet"><figcaption>picture by David Martin Jr.</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, there are some steps that can be taken to ensure that the links remain up-to-date. The first step is to regularly check the links to make sure that they are still valid. This can be done manually, or by using a tool such as a link checker. Additionally, it is important to keep track of any changes that are made to the links, so that they can be updated as needed.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another option is to use a tool such as a web crawler to scan the web for any changes to the links. This can be a time-consuming process, but it can be useful for ensuring that the links remain up-to-date. Additionally, it can be used to identify any broken links, which can then be fixed.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/347135/pexels-photo-347135.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-wearing-black-bra-and-white-tank-top-raising-both-hands-on-top"><figcaption>picture by Tirachard Kumtanom</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to keep track of any changes to the Windows platform itself. This can help to ensure that the links remain valid, as any changes to the platform may affect the links. Additionally, it can help to identify any new resources that may be available.</p><br>
