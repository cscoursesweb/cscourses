                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use Domain Name System (DNS) to mount Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) across multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and accounts with Amazon Transit Gateway. We will discuss the benefits of using DNS to mount EFS, the prerequisites for setting up the environment, and the steps required to configure the environment. We will also provide troubleshooting tips and best practices for using DNS to mount EFS across multiple VPCs and accounts. Finally, we will discuss the security implications of using DNS to mount EFS.">

                        <p class="article-text">Mounting an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) from different Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in different AWS accounts using a Transit Gateway and DNS can be a complex process. However, with the right setup, it can be done with relative ease. In this article, we will discuss the steps necessary to mount an EFS from different VPCs in different accounts using a Transit Gateway and DNS.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to create a Transit Gateway in the account that will be hosting the EFS. This Transit Gateway will be used to connect the different VPCs in different accounts. Once the Transit Gateway is created, it must be configured to allow traffic from the different VPCs. This can be done by creating a route table for each VPC and associating it with the Transit Gateway.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33488/navigation-car-drive-road.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="smartphone-car-technology-phone"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to create an EFS in the account that will be hosting the EFS. This EFS will be used to store the data that will be shared between the different VPCs. Once the EFS is created, it must be configured to allow traffic from the different VPCs. This can be done by creating a security group for each VPC and associating it with the EFS.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The final step is to configure DNS so that the different VPCs can access the EFS. This can be done by creating a DNS record for each VPC that points to the EFS. Once the DNS records are created, the different VPCs can access the EFS by using the DNS name.</p><br>
