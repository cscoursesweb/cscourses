                        <p class="article-text">If you recently upgraded your iPhone from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, you may be wondering where your old reminders have gone. Fortunately, Apple has made it easy to transfer your reminders from one device to another. Here’s how to find your old reminders on your new iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, make sure that you have iCloud enabled on both your old iPhone 6 and your new iPhone 14 Pro Max. This will allow your reminders to sync between the two devices. To enable iCloud, go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud and make sure that the toggle switch next to Reminders is turned on.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/788946/pexels-photo-788946.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="silver-iphone-x-with-airpods"><figcaption>picture by Jess Bailey Designs</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once iCloud is enabled, your reminders should automatically sync between your old iPhone 6 and your new iPhone 14 Pro Max. To check if your reminders have synced, open the Reminders app on your new iPhone 14 Pro Max. You should see all of your old reminders listed in the app.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you don’t see your old reminders in the Reminders app, you may need to manually transfer them from your old iPhone 6 to your new iPhone 14 Pro Max. To do this, open the Reminders app on your old iPhone 6 and select the reminders you want to transfer. Tap the Share icon in the top right corner and select “Copy to iCloud”. This will copy the reminders to your iCloud account.</p><br><p class="article-text">Next, open the Reminders app on your new iPhone 14 Pro Max and select the “iCloud” tab at the top. You should see the reminders you just copied to iCloud listed here. Tap the reminders you want to transfer and select “Copy to iPhone”. This will transfer the reminders to your new iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you’ve transferred your old reminders to your new iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can delete them from your old iPhone 6 if you wish. To do this, open the Reminders app on your old iPhone 6 and select the reminders you want to delete. Tap the Delete icon in the top right corner and select “Delete from My iPhone”. This will delete the reminders from your old iPhone 6.</p><br>
