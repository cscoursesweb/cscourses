        <p class="article-text">What is File Mapping Corruption?</p><br><p class="article-text">File mapping corruption occurs when a computer user attempts to access a file or folder on their system, but the system is unable to locate the file or folder. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including hardware or software malfunctions, viruses, and user error. When this happens, the user will be unable to access the file or folder, and the system may display an error message.</p><br><p class="article-text">What Causes File Mapping Corruption?</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/681335/pexels-photo-681335.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="aerial-photo-of-buildings-and-roads"><figcaption>picture by Aleksejs Bergmanis</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">There are several potential causes of file mapping corruption. These include hardware or software malfunctions, viruses, and user error.</p><br><p class="article-text">Hardware or software malfunctions can cause file mapping corruption if the hardware or software is not functioning properly. This can be caused by a variety of issues, such as a faulty hard drive, a corrupted operating system, or a malfunctioning device driver.</p><br><p class="article-text">Viruses can also cause file mapping corruption. Viruses can corrupt files and folders, making them inaccessible to the user.</p><br><p class="article-text">Finally, user error can also cause file mapping corruption.
