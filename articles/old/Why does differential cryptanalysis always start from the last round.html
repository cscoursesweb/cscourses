                <title>Why does differential cryptanalysis always start from the last round?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Differential cryptanalysis is a powerful technique used to break cryptographic algorithms. It is based on the idea that if two ciphertexts are generated from the same plaintext, but with different keys, then the differences between the two ciphertexts can be used to determine the key. Differential cryptanalysis always starts from the last round because the differences between the two ciphertexts are most pronounced at the end of the encryption process. This is because the last round of encryption is the most vulnerable to attack, as it is the last layer of protection for the plaintext. By starting from the last round, differential cryptanalysis can quickly identify the key used to encrypt the plaintext.">
