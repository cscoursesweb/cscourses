                        <p class="article-text">The GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) is a widely used open source software license that grants users the right to use, modify, and redistribute software.

        <p class="article-text">The GPLv3 is a copyleft license, meaning that any derivative works must also be released under the same license. This ensures that the source code remains open and available to all users. It also prevents developers from using the code in proprietary software, as they must also make their modifications available to the public.</p><br><p class="article-text">When it comes to web programs, the GPLv3 is a great choice for developers who want to share their work with others. It allows them to keep control over their code while still allowing others to use and modify it.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind when using the GPLv3 for web programs. First, the license requires that any derivative works must also be released under the same license. This means that if you modify a web program released under the GPLv3, you must also make your modifications available to the public.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, the GPLv3 does not cover web services. This means that if you are developing a web service, you must use a different license.</p><br>
