                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Responsive web design is becoming increasingly important in today’s digital world. As more and more people access websites from mobile devices, it’s essential to ensure that your website looks great and functions properly on any device. One of the most important aspects of responsive design is centering content on a page, especially when there are multiple elements such as a sidebar and top menu.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Fortunately, there are a few different ways to center content responsively with a sidebar and top menu on the same page. The first option is to use a grid system. Grid systems are a great way to organize content on a page and make it easier to center elements. Popular grid systems such as Bootstrap and Foundation make it easy to create a responsive layout with a sidebar and top menu.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4818718/pexels-photo-4818718.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blackboard-with-inscription-and-mask-on-black-background"><figcaption>picture by Brett Sayles</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another option is to use Flexbox. Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts. It allows you to easily center elements on a page, regardless of the size of the screen. You can also use Flexbox to create a sidebar and top menu that are both centered on the page.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can use CSS media queries to create a responsive layout. Media queries allow you to create different styles for different screen sizes. This means that you can create a layout that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. You can also use media queries to center the sidebar and top menu on the page.</p><br>
