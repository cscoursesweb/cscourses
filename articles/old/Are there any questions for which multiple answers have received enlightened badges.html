        <p class="article-text">The short answer is yes. Enlightened badges are awarded to answers that are particularly helpful and insightful. They are awarded by the community, and can be given to multiple answers on the same question.</p><br><p class="article-text">Enlightened badges are awarded to answers that demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic, provide a comprehensive answer, and are well-researched. They are awarded to answers that are particularly helpful and insightful, and that provide a unique perspective or solution to the question.</p><br><p class="article-text">The criteria for awarding an enlightened badge is subjective, and can vary from question to question. However, some questions have multiple answers that have been awarded enlightened badges.</p><br><p class="article-text">For example, a question about the best way to learn a new language might have multiple answers that have been awarded enlightened badges. Each answer might provide a unique perspective on the best way to learn a language, and each answer might be well-researched and comprehensive.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another example might be a question about the best way to save money. Again, multiple answers might be awarded enlightened badges, as each answer might provide a unique perspective on the best way to save money, and each answer might be well-researched and comprehensive.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/313691/pexels-photo-313691.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-pointing-on-the-screen-of-a-laptop"><figcaption>picture by energepic.com</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In general, questions that have multiple answers that have been awarded enlightened badges are questions that are open-ended and require a lot of research and thought. They are questions that require a unique perspective or solution, and that require a comprehensive answer.</p><br>
