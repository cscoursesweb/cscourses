They are cartoon-like avatars that you can customize to look like you, or anyone else you want. But how do you differentiate between male and female Bitmojis?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The easiest way to differentiate between male and female Bitmojis is by looking at the facial features. Male Bitmojis typically have a square jaw, a more angular face, and a shorter hairstyle. Female Bitmojis usually have a rounder face, softer features, and longer hair. You can also look at the clothing and accessories that the Bitmoji is wearing. Male Bitmojis often wear more masculine clothing, such as t-shirts and jeans, while female Bitmojis often wear more feminine clothing, such as dresses and skirts.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another way to differentiate between male and female Bitmojis is by looking at the body type. Male Bitmojis usually have a more muscular physique, while female Bitmojis tend to have a more slender body type. You can also look at the color of the skin. Male Bitmojis usually have a darker skin tone, while female Bitmojis usually have a lighter skin tone.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can look at the facial expressions of the Bitmoji. Male Bitmojis often have a more serious expression, while female Bitmojis often have a more cheerful expression.</p><br>
