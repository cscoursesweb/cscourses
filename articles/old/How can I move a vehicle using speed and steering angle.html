                        <p class="article-text">Moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is a skill that is essential for any driver. It is important to understand how to properly control the speed and steering angle of a vehicle in order to safely and efficiently navigate the roads.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is to understand the basics of acceleration and deceleration. Acceleration is the process of increasing the speed of a vehicle, while deceleration is the process of decreasing the speed of a vehicle. When accelerating, the driver should press the accelerator pedal to increase the speed of the vehicle. When decelerating, the driver should press the brake pedal to decrease the speed of the vehicle.</p><br><p class="article-text">The second step in moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is to understand the basics of steering. Steering is the process of turning the vehicle in a desired direction. The steering wheel is used to control the direction of the vehicle. When turning the steering wheel, the driver should turn it in the desired direction until the vehicle is pointed in the desired direction.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third step in moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is to understand the basics of cornering. Cornering is the process of turning the vehicle while maintaining a constant speed. When cornering, the driver should turn the steering wheel in the desired direction while maintaining a constant speed. This will allow the vehicle to turn in the desired direction without losing speed.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11133269/pexels-photo-11133269.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blue-race-car-on-the-track"><figcaption>picture by Philipp Fahlbusch</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The fourth step in moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is to understand the basics of braking. Braking is the process of slowing down the vehicle. When braking, the driver should press the brake pedal to decrease the speed of the vehicle.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The fifth step in moving a vehicle using speed and steering angle is to understand the basics of shifting. Shifting is the process of changing gears in order to increase or decrease the speed of the vehicle. When shifting, the driver should press the clutch pedal to disengage the engine from the transmission and then move the gear shift lever to the desired gear.</p><br>
