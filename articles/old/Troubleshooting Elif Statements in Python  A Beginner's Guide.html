                        <p class="article-text">Welcome to the world of Python programming! If you are new to Python, you may be wondering why your elif statement is not working within a while loop. This is a common issue for new Python programmers, and it can be easily resolved with a few simple steps.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, let's take a look at what an elif statement is and how it works. An elif statement is a conditional statement that is used to check for multiple conditions. It is similar to an if statement, but it allows for multiple conditions to be checked. For example, if you wanted to check if a number is greater than 10 and less than 20, you could use an elif statement to do so.</p><br><p class="article-text">Now, let's look at why your elif statement is not working within a while loop. The problem is that the elif statement is only checked once, when the loop is first entered. This means that if the condition is met, the loop will continue to run without ever checking the elif statement again. To fix this, you need to use a break statement within the loop.</p><br><p class="article-text">A break statement is used to exit a loop. When the break statement is encountered, the loop will immediately exit and the program will continue to the next line of code. By using a break statement within the loop, you can ensure that the elif statement is checked each time the loop is run.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5404164/pexels-photo-5404164.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="eyeglasses-annd-book"><figcaption>picture by June</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Now that you know why your elif statement is not working within a while loop, let's look at how to fix it. To do this, you will need to add a break statement within the loop. This break statement should be placed after the elif statement, so that it is checked each time the loop is run.</p><br><p class="article-text">For example, let's say you have a loop that checks if a number is greater than 10 and less than 20. You could use the following code to do this:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14880244/pexels-photo-14880244.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="greater-adjutant-walking-on-shallow-waters"><figcaption>picture by Kirandeep Singh Walia</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">while True:</p><br><p class="article-text">    if num > 10 and num < 20:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6591763/pexels-photo-6591763.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="beautiful-women-holding-their-placards-in-white-background"><figcaption>picture by olia danilevich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">        break</p><br><p class="article-text">        print("The number is greater than 20")</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1061137/pexels-photo-1061137.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gray-metal-chain"><figcaption>picture by Miguel Á.

                        <p class="article-text">In this example, the break statement is placed after the elif statement. This ensures that the elif statement is checked each time the loop is run. If the condition is met, the loop will exit and the program will continue to the next line of code.</p><br>
