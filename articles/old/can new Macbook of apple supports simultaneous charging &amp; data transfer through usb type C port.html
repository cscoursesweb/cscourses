        <p class="article-text">The answer is yes, the new Macbook can support simultaneous charging and data transfer through the USB Type-C port. This is because the USB Type-C port is a new type of port that is designed to be able to handle both charging and data transfer at the same time. This means that you can charge your laptop while also transferring data, such as photos or videos, at the same time.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4792748/pexels-photo-4792748.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-using-laptop-sitting-on-bench-with-flash-drive"><figcaption>picture by Anete Lusina</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">The USB Type-C port is also capable of transferring data at a much faster rate than traditional USB ports. This means that you can transfer large files quickly and easily, without having to wait for the transfer to finish. Additionally, the USB Type-C port is also capable of providing power to other devices, such as external hard drives or monitors. This means that you can use the USB Type-C port to power other devices, while also charging your laptop and transferring data at the same time.</p><br>
