                        <p class="article-text">If you’re an avid smartphone user, you’ve probably noticed that some apps close after a few minutes of inactivity. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you’re trying to multitask or keep an app open in the background. Fortunately, there are a few ways to keep an app open in the background so you can get the most out of your device.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first way to keep an app open in the background is to enable background data. This is a setting that allows apps to continue running even when you’re not actively using them. To enable background data, go to your device’s Settings menu and select “Data Usage.” From there, you can select the app you want to keep running and toggle the “Allow background data” option.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/177598/pexels-photo-177598.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-laptop-computer-turned-on-showing-computer-codes"><figcaption>picture by Markus Spiske</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another way to keep an app open in the background is to use a task manager. Task managers are apps that allow you to manage the apps running on your device. They can be used to close apps that are running in the background, as well as to keep certain apps running. To use a task manager, simply download one from the app store and open it. From there, you can select the apps you want to keep running and the ones you want to close.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can also keep an app open in the background by using a “persistent notification.” This is a notification that will appear in your notification bar and will keep the app running in the background. To enable a persistent notification, open the app you want to keep running and select the “Settings” option. From there, you can enable the “Persistent Notification” option.</p><br>
