                        <p class="article-text">HTML and CSS are two of the most important coding languages used to create websites. They are used to create the structure and design of a website, respectively. One of the most common elements of a website is the navigation bar, which is usually placed at the top of the page. However, sometimes the navigation bar can end up at the bottom of the page unintentionally. This can be a frustrating issue for web developers, as it can be difficult to figure out why the navigation bar is not displaying correctly.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most common cause of this issue is a lack of understanding of the HTML and CSS coding languages. HTML and CSS are both used to create the structure and design of a website, and if either of these coding languages is not properly understood, it can lead to the navigation bar being placed at the bottom of the page.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5416439/pexels-photo-5416439.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-shot-of-a-person-sailing-a-watercraft"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In order to fix this issue, it is important to understand the basics of HTML and CSS. HTML is used to create the structure of a website, while CSS is used to create the design. In order to ensure that the navigation bar is placed at the top of the page, it is important to understand how to use HTML and CSS to create the structure and design of the website.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the basics of HTML and CSS are understood, it is important to ensure that the navigation bar is placed in the correct place in the HTML code. The navigation bar should be placed within the <body> tag, and should be placed before any other content on the page. This will ensure that the navigation bar is placed at the top of the page, and will not be unintentionally placed at the bottom.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8919708/pexels-photo-8919708.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-couple-looking-at-each-other"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">It is also important to ensure that the navigation bar is styled correctly using CSS. The navigation bar should be given a fixed position, so that it will remain at the top of the page even when the user scrolls down. This can be done by using the position: fixed; property in the CSS code.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to ensure that the navigation bar is given enough space to display correctly. If the navigation bar is too small, it may be pushed to the bottom of the page unintentionally. This can be fixed by giving the navigation bar a minimum width, or by using a responsive design that will adjust the size of the navigation bar depending on the size of the screen.</p><br>
