        <p class="article-text">When it comes to implementing queues for the people on an escalator (FIFO) using dynamic single linked list by using switch statements in C, there are a few potential errors that can occur. This article will discuss the most common errors that can occur when implementing queues for the people on an escalator (FIFO) using dynamic single linked list by using switch statements in C.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2087514/pexels-photo-2087514.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="low-angle-photo-of-escalator"><figcaption>picture by Chris F</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first error that can occur is a memory leak. This occurs when memory is allocated for a data structure, but the memory is not freed when the data structure is no longer needed. This can lead to a situation where the program is using more and more memory, leading to a decrease in performance. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all allocated memory is freed when it is no longer needed.</p><br><p class="article-text">The second error that can occur is a segmentation fault. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it does not have permission to access. This can lead to a crash of the program, and can be difficult to debug. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all memory accesses are valid and within the bounds of the allocated memory.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6045291/pexels-photo-6045291.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="abstract-background-with-wavy-pattern"><figcaption>picture by Skylar Kang</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The third error that can occur is an infinite loop. This occurs when a loop is written in such a way that it never terminates. This can lead to a situation where the program is stuck in an infinite loop, leading to a decrease in performance. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all loops have a termination condition.</p><br><p class="article-text">The fourth error that can occur is a stack overflow. This occurs when a program attempts to allocate more memory than is available on the stack. This can lead to a crash of the program, and can be difficult to debug. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all memory allocations are within the bounds of the available stack memory.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fifth error that can occur is a buffer overflow. This occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer than is available. This can lead to a crash of the program, and can be difficult to debug. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all data written to a buffer is within the bounds of the available buffer memory.</p><br>
