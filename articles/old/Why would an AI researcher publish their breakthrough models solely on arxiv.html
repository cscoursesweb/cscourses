                <meta name="description" content="An AI researcher may choose to publish their breakthrough models solely on arXiv for a variety of reasons. ArXiv is an open-access repository for scientific papers, allowing anyone to access and read the research without needing to pay a fee. This makes it an ideal platform for researchers to share their work with the world, as it allows for a wider audience to access the research. Additionally, arXiv is a well-known and respected platform, meaning that the research is more likely to be taken seriously by the scientific community. Finally, arXiv is a great platform for researchers to receive feedback on their work, as it allows for comments and discussion from other researchers. By publishing their breakthrough models solely on arXiv, an AI researcher can ensure that their work is widely accessible, taken seriously, and open to feedback.">
