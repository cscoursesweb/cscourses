                <title>Where did Cura get this ghost layer from?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Cura is a popular 3D printing software that is used to slice 3D models into layers for printing. One of the features of Cura is the “ghost layer”, which is a layer that is printed but not visible. This layer helps to improve the quality of the 3D print by providing additional support for the model. But where did Cura get this ghost layer from? 

The ghost layer was first developed by the 3D printing company Ultimaker. Ultimaker developed the ghost layer to help improve the quality of 3D prints and reduce the amount of time needed to print a model. The ghost layer was then adopted by Cura and is now a popular feature of the software. 

The ghost layer is a great tool for 3D printing and has helped to improve the quality of 3D prints. Thanks to Ultimaker, Cura now has this feature and can help 3D printing enthusiasts get the best results from their prints">

PVA is a water-soluble filament that is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful. PVA is a special type of filament that is designed to dissolve in water, so it can be easily removed from the model after the print is complete.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The ghost layer is printed using a special type of printer called a dual extruder printer. A dual extruder printer is a type of 3D printer that has two extruders, one for the model and one for the ghost layer. The ghost layer is printed using the second extruder, and it is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful.</p><br>
