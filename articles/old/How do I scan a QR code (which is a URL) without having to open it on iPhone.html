                <meta name="description" content="Scanning a QR code (which is a URL) on an iPhone is a simple process. All you need is the camera app and a QR code reader app. 

First, open the camera app on your iPhone and point it at the QR code. The camera will automatically detect the code and display a notification. Tap on the notification to open the QR code reader app. 

Once the QR code reader app is open, it will scan the code and display the URL. You can then open the URL in your browser or save it for later. 

With this method, you can quickly and easily scan a QR code (which is a URL) without having to open it on your iPhone.">

                        <p class="article-text">Scanning a QR code (which is a URL) without having to open it on iPhone is a simple process. QR codes are becoming increasingly popular as a way to quickly access websites, and they can be found on everything from business cards to product packaging. Fortunately, scanning a QR code without having to open it on iPhone is easy and can be done in just a few steps.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to make sure you have the right app installed on your iPhone. There are several apps available that can scan QR codes, but the most popular one is the built-in Camera app. To access the Camera app, simply open the app drawer on your iPhone and tap the Camera icon.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/207580/pexels-photo-207580.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blur-bright-business-codes"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have the Camera app open, you will need to point it at the QR code.
