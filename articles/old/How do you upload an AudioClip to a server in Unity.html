                        <p class="article-text">Uploading an AudioClip to a server in Unity is a relatively straightforward process. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps necessary to get your AudioClip uploaded and ready to use.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure you have the necessary tools and resources. You’ll need a Unity project, an audio file, and a server to upload the file to.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/257904/pexels-photo-257904.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="low-angle-view-of-lighting-equipment-on-shelf"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have all of the necessary resources, you’ll need to create an AudioClip in Unity. To do this, open the Assets window and select the “Create” option. From the drop-down menu, select “AudioClip”. This will open a window where you can select the audio file you want to upload. Select the file and click “Open”.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the AudioClip is created, you’ll need to upload it to the server. To do this, open the Build Settings window and select the “Build” option. This will open a window where you can select the platform you want to build for. Select the platform you want to upload the AudioClip to and click “Build”.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/158918/pexels-photo-158918.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-and-black-subway-train-inside-station"><figcaption>picture by Justin Hamilton</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the build is complete, you’ll need to upload the AudioClip to the server. To do this, open the FTP client of your choice and connect to the server. Once connected, navigate to the folder where you want to upload the AudioClip and select the file. Click “Upload” to begin the upload process.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the upload is complete, you’ll need to make sure the AudioClip is accessible from the server. To do this, open the server’s web interface and navigate to the folder where the AudioClip is located. Make sure the file is accessible and can be played.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181354/pexels-photo-1181354.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="software-engineer-standing-beside-server-racks"><figcaption>picture by Christina Morillo</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the AudioClip is accessible, you’ll need to add it to your Unity project. To do this, open the Assets window and select the “Import” option. From the drop-down menu, select “AudioClip”. This will open a window where you can select the AudioClip you want to import. Select the file and click “Import”.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the AudioClip is imported, you’ll need to add it to your scene. To do this, open the Hierarchy window and select the “Create” option. From the drop-down menu, select “AudioSource”. This will open a window where you can select the AudioClip you want to use. Select the file and click “Create”.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the AudioSource is created, you’ll need to configure it. To do this, open the Inspector window and select the “AudioSource” component. This will open a window where you can configure the AudioSource. Make sure the “Clip” field is set to the AudioClip you uploaded and click “Apply”.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the AudioSource is configured, you’re ready to use it in your project. You can now play the AudioClip in your scene and it will be streamed from the server.</p><br>
