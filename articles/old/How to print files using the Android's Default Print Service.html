                        <p class="article-text">Printing documents from your Android device is now easier than ever with the Android's Default Print Service. This service allows you to print documents directly from your Android device to any compatible printer. In this article, we will explain how to print files using the Android's Default Print Service.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you will need to make sure that your printer is compatible with the Android's Default Print Service. To do this, you will need to check the printer's specifications to see if it supports the service. If it does, you will need to install the printer's driver on your Android device.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12935044/pexels-photo-12935044.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="worker-using-a-touchscreen-monitor"><figcaption>picture by iMin Technology</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the printer's driver is installed, you will need to open the file that you want to print. You can do this by opening the file in any compatible app, such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Once the file is open, you will need to tap the "Print" button in the app. This will open the Android's Default Print Service.</p><br><p class="article-text">The Android's Default Print Service will then display a list of available printers. You will need to select the printer that you want to use. Once you have selected the printer, you will need to select the number of copies that you want to print. You can also adjust the print settings, such as the paper size and orientation.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/47261/pexels-photo-47261.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="silver-samsung-smartphone"><figcaption>picture by MOHI SYED</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you have adjusted the print settings, you will need to tap the "Print" button. This will send the file to the printer and it will begin printing. Depending on the printer, it may take a few minutes for the file to print.</p><br>
