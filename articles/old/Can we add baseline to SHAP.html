                <meta name="description" content="This article will provide an overview of the concept of adding a baseline to SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and explain the potential benefits of doing so. We will discuss the different types of baselines that can be used, the advantages of adding a baseline to SHAP, and the potential drawbacks of doing so. We will also provide some examples of how baselines can be used in SHAP to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. Finally, we will provide some tips for getting the most out of adding a baseline to SHAP.">

                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether we can add baseline to SHAP is yes. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to explain the output of any machine learning model. It does this by decomposing the output of the model into a set of feature contributions, which can then be used to understand the model’s behavior.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The baseline is an important part of the SHAP algorithm. It is the value that is used to compare the feature contributions against. Without the baseline, the feature contributions would be meaningless. The baseline is typically set to the average value of the model’s output, but it can also be set to any other value.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1618200/pexels-photo-1618200.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="football-game"><figcaption>picture by football wife</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The baseline can be added to SHAP in two ways. The first is to explicitly set the baseline in the SHAP algorithm. This can be done by setting the “baseline” parameter in the SHAP algorithm to the desired value. The second way is to use the “add_baseline” function in the SHAP library. This function allows you to add a baseline to the SHAP algorithm without explicitly setting the baseline parameter.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition to setting the baseline, it is also important to consider how the baseline is used in the SHAP algorithm. The baseline is used to compare the feature contributions against, so it is important to make sure that the baseline is set to a value that is representative of the data. If the baseline is set to a value that is too high or too low, then the feature contributions may not be meaningful.</p><br>
