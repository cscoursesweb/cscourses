                        <p class="article-text">Recording manual actions and converting them to adb shell am start intents/actions is a great way to automate tasks on an Android device. This process can be used to automate a variety of tasks, from launching apps to sending text messages. In this article, we’ll discuss how to record manual actions and convert them to adb shell am start intents/actions.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in recording manual actions and converting them to adb shell am start intents/actions is to install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your computer. ADB is a command-line tool that allows you to communicate with an Android device. Once you have ADB installed, you can connect your Android device to your computer via USB and begin recording manual actions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12568578/pexels-photo-12568578.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="traffic-on-bridge-in-morning"><figcaption>picture by Halil İbrahim  ÇETİN</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">To record manual actions, you’ll need to use the “adb shell am start” command. This command will allow you to record the actions you take on your Android device. For example, if you want to record the action of launching an app, you would type “adb shell am start -n com.example.app/.MainActivity” into the command line. This command will launch the app on your device and record the action.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you’ve recorded the manual actions, you can convert them to adb shell am start intents/actions. To do this, you’ll need to use the “adb shell am start --user 0” command. This command will allow you to convert the recorded manual actions into an intent/action that can be used to automate tasks on your Android device.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7962923/pexels-photo-7962923.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="skateboarder-performing-a-trick"><figcaption>picture by William Choquette</figcaption></figure>
