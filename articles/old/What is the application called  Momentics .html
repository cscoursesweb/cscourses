                        <p class="article-text">Momentics is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry QNX. It is a powerful tool for developing applications for BlackBerry 10 and QNX-based devices. Momentics is a complete development environment that includes an editor, compiler, debugger, and other tools.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The Momentics IDE is a large application that requires a significant amount of disk space. It typically occupies around 4.2 GB of hard disk space. This is because it includes a large number of libraries, tools, and other resources that are necessary for developing applications for BlackBerry 10 and QNX-based devices.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14891035/pexels-photo-14891035.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-couple-sitting-near-a-lake-and-bridge"><figcaption>picture by Jean Marc Bonnel</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you are not actively developing applications for BlackBerry 10 or QNX-based devices, then you can delete the Momentics IDE from your hard disk. However, if you are actively developing applications for these platforms, then it is recommended that you keep the Momentics IDE installed on your hard disk.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It is also important to note that the Momentics IDE is not the only tool available for developing applications for BlackBerry 10 and QNX-based devices. There are other development tools available, such as the BlackBerry Native SDK and the BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK. These tools are much smaller in size and do not require as much disk space as the Momentics IDE.</p><br>
