        <p class="article-text">If you’re having trouble accessing the internet in Chrome but MS Edge (Chromium) works fine, you’re not alone. Many users have experienced this issue, and it can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are a few potential solutions that can help you get back online.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3059747/pexels-photo-3059747.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-writing-on-her-notebook"><figcaption>picture by RF._.studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first thing to do is to check your internet connection. Make sure that your router is connected to the internet and that your computer is connected to the router. If your connection is working, then the issue may be with Chrome itself.</p><br><p class="article-text">One potential cause of the issue is that Chrome is not set up to use the correct proxy settings. To check this, open Chrome and go to the “Settings” menu. Then, click on “Advanced” and select “Open Proxy Settings.” Make sure that the “Automatically detect settings” box is checked. If it is not, then check it and click “OK.”</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1482061/pexels-photo-1482061.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-google-smartphone-on-box"><figcaption>picture by Deepanker Verma</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another potential cause of the issue is that Chrome is not set up to use the correct DNS settings. To check this, open Chrome and go to the “Settings” menu. Then, click on “Advanced” and select “Change proxy settings.” Make sure that the “Use the system’s DNS settings” box is checked. If it is not, then check it and click “OK.”</p><br><p class="article-text">If neither of these solutions works, then the issue may be with your antivirus or firewall software. Some antivirus and firewall programs can block certain websites or internet connections. To check this, open your antivirus or firewall program and look for any settings that may be blocking Chrome. If you find any, then disable them and try accessing the internet in Chrome again.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6963098/pexels-photo-6963098.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-people-night-dark"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if none of these solutions work, then the issue may be with Chrome itself. To fix this, you can try reinstalling Chrome. To do this, open the “Control Panel” and select “Uninstall a program.” Then, find Chrome in the list of programs and click “Uninstall.” Once Chrome is uninstalled, you can download and install the latest version from the Chrome website.</p><br>
