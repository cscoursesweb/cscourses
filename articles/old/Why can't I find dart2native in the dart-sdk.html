                        <p class="article-text">The Dart SDK is a powerful toolkit for developing applications in the Dart programming language. It includes a wide range of tools and libraries for building applications, including the dart2native compiler. Unfortunately, the dart2native compiler is not included in the Dart SDK.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The dart2native compiler is a tool that allows developers to compile Dart code into native code. This means that the code can be run on a variety of platforms, including mobile devices, without the need for a virtual machine. This makes it possible to create applications that are more efficient and perform better than those written in other languages.</p><br><p class="article-text">The reason why the dart2native compiler is not included in the Dart SDK is because it is still in development. The dart2native compiler is a relatively new tool and is still being improved and refined. As such, it is not yet ready for production use.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition, the dart2native compiler is not open source. This means that developers cannot access the source code and modify it to suit their needs. This makes it difficult for developers to customize the compiler to their specific needs.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Despite the fact that the dart2native compiler is not included in the Dart SDK, it is still possible to use it. The dart2native compiler is available as a separate download from the official Dart website. Once downloaded, developers can use the compiler to compile their Dart code into native code.</p><br>
