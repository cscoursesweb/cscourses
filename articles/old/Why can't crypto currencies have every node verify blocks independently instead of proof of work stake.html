                <meta name="description" content="Cryptocurrencies rely on a consensus mechanism to ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the same state of the blockchain. Without a consensus mechanism, it would be impossible to prevent double-spending and other malicious activities. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two of the most popular consensus mechanisms used in cryptocurrencies. PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to add new blocks to the blockchain, while PoS requires users to stake their coins in order to validate transactions. Both of these consensus mechanisms are necessary to ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the same state of the blockchain. Without them, it would be impossible to prevent double-spending and other malicious activities.">

                        <p class="article-text">Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography and used as a medium of exchange. They are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any central authority or government. As such, they rely on a consensus mechanism to ensure that all transactions are valid and secure.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most common consensus mechanism used by cryptocurrencies is proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS). These mechanisms are used to verify blocks of transactions and ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of the transactions.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, it is not possible for every node in the network to independently verify blocks of transactions. This is because the process of verifying blocks is computationally intensive and requires a significant amount of computing power. As such, it would be impractical for every node in the network to independently verify blocks.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition, if every node in the network were to independently verify blocks, it would lead to a situation where the network is vulnerable to a 51% attack. This is because if a single entity or group of entities were to control more than 50% of the network’s computing power, they would be able to manipulate the network and double-spend coins.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1476321/pexels-photo-1476321.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blue-and-yellow-phone-modules"><figcaption>picture by Dan Cristian Pădureț</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Proof of work and proof of stake are designed to prevent this type of attack by ensuring that no single entity or group of entities can control more than 50% of the network’s computing power. In proof of work, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to verify blocks and earn rewards. In proof of stake, users stake their coins in order to verify blocks and earn rewards.</p><br>
