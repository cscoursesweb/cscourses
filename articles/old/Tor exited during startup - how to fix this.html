        <p class="article-text">First, make sure that you’re using the latest version of Tor. Outdated versions can cause issues with startup, so it’s important to make sure you’re running the most up-to-date version. You can check for updates on the Tor website.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9860597/pexels-photo-9860597.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="walk-path-on-the-mountain"><figcaption>picture by Jack Williams</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If you’re still having trouble, try disabling any antivirus or firewall software you have running. These programs can interfere with Tor’s startup process, so disabling them may help.</p><br><p class="article-text">If that doesn’t work, try running Tor in “Safe Mode.” This will disable any add-ons or plugins you have installed, which can sometimes cause startup issues. To do this, open the Tor browser and press the “Alt” key. This will bring up a menu. Select “Start Tor Browser in Safe Mode.”</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/267469/pexels-photo-267469.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="access-application-browser-connection"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If none of these steps work, you may need to reinstall Tor. To do this, go to the Tor website and download the latest version. Once it’s downloaded, uninstall the old version and install the new one.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">If you’re still having trouble, you may need to contact Tor’s support team. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and get Tor running again.</p><br>
