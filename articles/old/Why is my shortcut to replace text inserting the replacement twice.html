                        <p class="article-text">If you’ve ever used a shortcut to replace text in a document, you may have noticed that the replacement text is inserted twice. This can be a frustrating issue, especially if you’re trying to quickly edit a document. So why is this happening?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most likely cause of this issue is that you’re using a shortcut that is designed to replace the selected text with the replacement text twice. This is a common feature in many text editors and word processors, and it’s intended to make it easier to quickly replace multiple instances of the same text.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5939143/pexels-photo-5939143.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="caramba-spelled-on-purple-letter-tiles"><figcaption>picture by Anna Tarazevich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">However, if you’re not expecting this behavior, it can be confusing and annoying. Fortunately, there are a few ways to fix this issue.</p><br><p class="article-text">The first option is to use a different shortcut. Many text editors and word processors have multiple shortcuts for replacing text, and some of them may not insert the replacement text twice. If you’re using a program like Microsoft Word, you can find a list of available shortcuts by pressing the “Alt” key and then selecting “Help” from the menu.</p><br><p class="article-text">The second option is to disable the shortcut that is inserting the replacement text twice. This can be done by going into the program’s settings and disabling the shortcut. Again, if you’re using Microsoft Word, you can find the shortcut settings by pressing the “Alt” key and then selecting “Options” from the menu.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re using a text editor or word processor that doesn’t have a shortcut for replacing text, you can use the “Find and Replace” feature. This feature allows you to search for a specific word or phrase and then replace it with the desired text. This is a great way to quickly replace multiple instances of the same text without having to worry about the replacement text being inserted twice.</p><br>
