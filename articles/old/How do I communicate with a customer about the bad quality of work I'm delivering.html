Start by apologizing for the poor quality of work and explain the steps you are taking to rectify the situation. Offer a timeline for when the customer can expect the work to be completed and provide a plan of action for how you will ensure the quality of the work is improved.

Finally, thank the customer for bringing the issue to your attention and assure them that you are taking the necessary steps to ensure the quality of the work is improved.">
