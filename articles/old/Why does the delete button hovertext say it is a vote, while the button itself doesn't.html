                <title>Why does the delete button hovertext say it is a vote, while the button itself doesn't?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The delete button on many websites is often accompanied by a hovertext that reads "This is a vote." However, the button itself does not actually cast a vote. So why does the hovertext say it is a vote?

The answer lies in the concept of "voting with your feet." This phrase is used to describe the idea that people can express their opinion or support for something by taking action. In this case, clicking the delete button is a way of expressing disapproval or disagreement with the content. By labeling the delete button as a "vote," the website is encouraging users to take action and make their opinion known.

In conclusion, the delete button hovertext says it is a vote because it is a way for users to express their opinion and take action. While the button itself does not actually cast a vote, it is still a form of voting with your feet.">

A vote is usually a decision made by a group of people, while the delete button is a decision made by a single user. Therefore, labeling the delete button as a “vote” would be misleading.</p><br>
