                        <p class="article-text">The answer to the question of whether a custom software plugin must be made open source under the AGPL 3.0 license depends on the specific circumstances of the plugin. The AGPL 3.0 is a type of open source license that requires any modifications or additions to the software to be made available under the same license. This means that if a custom software plugin is created for a program that is already licensed under the AGPL 3.0, then the plugin must also be made available under the same license.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">However, if the plugin is created for a program that is not licensed under the AGPL 3.0, then the plugin does not need to be made open source. In this case, the plugin can be kept proprietary and the developer can choose to license it under a different license.</p><br><p class="article-text">It is important to note that the AGPL 3.0 does not require that the source code of the plugin be made available. Instead, it requires that the plugin be made available under the same license as the program it is created for. This means that the plugin can be distributed as a binary file, as long as the license terms are followed.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition, the AGPL 3.0 does not require that the plugin be made available for free. The developer can choose to charge a fee for the plugin, as long as the license terms are followed.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4152505/pexels-photo-4152505.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="text"><figcaption>picture by Markus Winkler</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to note that the AGPL 3.0 does not require that the plugin be made available to the public. The developer can choose to keep the plugin private and only make it available to certain users.</p><br>
