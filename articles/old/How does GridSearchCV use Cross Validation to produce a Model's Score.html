                <meta name="description" content="GridSearchCV is a powerful tool used in machine learning to optimize hyperparameters and produce the best model. It uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a model on a given dataset. Cross-validation is a technique that splits the data into multiple subsets and uses each subset to train and test the model. GridSearchCV then uses the results of the cross-validation to determine the best hyperparameters for the model and produces a score that reflects the model's performance. This score can then be used to compare different models and select the best one.">

                        <p class="article-text">GridSearchCV is a powerful tool used in machine learning to find the best parameters for a given model. It uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a model and produce a score. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the accuracy of a model by splitting the data into training and testing sets.

        <p class="article-text">GridSearchCV uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a model by running multiple iterations of the model with different parameters. For each iteration, the data is split into training and testing sets. The model is then trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. The performance of the model is then evaluated based on the results of the testing set. The model with the best performance is then selected as the best model.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">GridSearchCV also uses cross-validation to produce a model's score. The score is calculated by taking the average of the scores of all the iterations of the model. This score is then used to compare the performance of different models and select the best model.</p><br>
