                        <p class="article-text">If you're like many people, you're probably inundated with notifications from WhatsApp. Whether it's from friends, family, or work colleagues, it can be overwhelming to keep up with all the messages. Fortunately, there is a way to disable notifications for WhatsApp except from specific people.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to open the WhatsApp app on your device. Once you're in the app, tap on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen. This will open the Settings menu. From here, select Notifications. This will open a list of all the notifications you have enabled for WhatsApp.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4132538/pexels-photo-4132538.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-person-holding-a-cellphone-with-logo-on-the-screen"><figcaption>picture by Anton</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you'll want to select the option to "Disable All Notifications." This will turn off all notifications from WhatsApp, except for those from specific people. To do this, tap on the "Allow Notifications from" option. This will open a list of all the contacts in your address book.</p><br><p class="article-text">From here, you can select which contacts you want to receive notifications from. Simply tap on the contact's name and then select the "Allow Notifications" option. This will ensure that you only receive notifications from the contacts you have selected.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/207419/pexels-photo-207419.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="announcement-clock-clock-face-departure"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have selected the contacts you want to receive notifications from, you can then go back to the Notifications menu and select the "Disable All Notifications" option again. This will ensure that you only receive notifications from the contacts you have selected.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It's important to note that this will only disable notifications from WhatsApp. If you want to disable notifications from other apps, you'll need to do this separately. To do this, you'll need to go into the Settings menu of each app and disable notifications from there.</p><br>
