This is the default behaviour of links in Apple Mail, but it can be changed to appear as text URLs. Here’s how you can do it.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, open Apple Mail and go to the “Preferences” menu. From there, select the “Viewing” tab. Under the “Viewing” tab, you will see an option for “Display Links as Text URLs”. Check the box next to this option to enable it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14838208/pexels-photo-14838208.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="metals-on-display"><figcaption>picture by Jimmy Liao</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have enabled this option, all links in emails will now appear as text URLs. This means that instead of seeing a blue, underlined link, you will now see a plain text URL. This can be useful if you want to copy and paste the link into a web browser, or if you want to share the link with someone else.</p><br><p class="article-text">It’s also worth noting that this setting will only apply to emails that you receive. If you are sending emails, the links will still appear as blue, underlined text. To change the default behaviour of links in emails that you are sending, you will need to go to the “Composing” tab in the “Preferences” menu. Under the “Composing” tab, you will see an option for “Display Links as Text URLs”. Check the box next to this option to enable it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12725461/pexels-photo-12725461.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-brown-envelope-on-a-wooden-table"><figcaption>picture by ROMAN ODINTSOV</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once you have enabled this option, all links in emails that you are sending will now appear as text URLs. This can be useful if you want to make sure that the recipient of your email can easily copy and paste the link into a web browser, or if you want to make sure that the link is clearly visible.</p><br>
