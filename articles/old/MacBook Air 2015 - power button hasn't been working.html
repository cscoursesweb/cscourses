                        <p class="article-text">If you have a MacBook Air 2015 and the power button isn't working, you may be wondering what to do. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to try and fix the issue.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you should check the power adapter. Make sure it is securely plugged into the wall outlet and the MacBook Air. If the adapter is loose, try plugging it in more securely. If the adapter is damaged, you may need to replace it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7400884/pexels-photo-7400884.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="network-adapter-with-wires-on-wall"><figcaption>picture by Nothing Ahead</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you should check the battery. Make sure it is properly connected to the laptop. If the battery is not connected, try reconnecting it. If the battery is damaged, you may need to replace it.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the power adapter and battery are both working properly, you may need to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). To do this, shut down your MacBook Air and unplug the power adapter. Then, press and hold the left Shift, Control, and Option keys on the keyboard, as well as the power button. Keep holding these keys and the power button for 10 seconds, then release them. Plug the power adapter back in and turn on your MacBook Air.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5114898/pexels-photo-5114898.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="modern-drone-flying-in-light-room"><figcaption>picture by Dids</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">If the power button still isn't working, you may need to take your laptop to an Apple Store or authorized service provider. They can diagnose the issue and determine if the power button needs to be replaced.</p><br>
