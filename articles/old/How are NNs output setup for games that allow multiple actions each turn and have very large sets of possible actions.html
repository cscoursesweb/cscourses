                <meta name="description" content="Neural networks (NNs) are powerful tools for creating game AI that can make decisions in complex, multi-action games. When setting up the output of a NN for such a game, it is important to consider the size of the action set and the number of possible actions each turn. This article will discuss the best practices for setting up the output of a NN for games that allow multiple actions each turn and have very large sets of possible actions. We will look at the different types of output layers, the importance of action selection, and the use of reinforcement learning to fine-tune the output. Finally, we will discuss how to evaluate the performance of the NN and how to adjust the output to improve the AI's decision-making.">

                        <p class="article-text">Neural networks (NNs) are powerful tools for creating artificial intelligence (AI) in games. They are used to create AI agents that can learn from experience and make decisions based on the data they receive. NNs are particularly useful for games that allow multiple actions each turn and have very large sets of possible actions. In this article, we will discuss how NNs can be set up to handle such games.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in setting up a NN for a game with multiple actions and a large set of possible actions is to define the input and output layers. The input layer should contain all the information that the AI agent needs to make decisions. This could include the current game state, the available actions, and any other relevant information. The output layer should contain the AI agentâ€™s decision. This could be a single action or a set of actions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5082554/pexels-photo-5082554.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="silver-imac-on-white-table"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the input and output layers are defined, the next step is to create the hidden layers. The hidden layers are responsible for processing the input data and making decisions. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer will depend on the complexity of the game and the number of possible actions. Generally, more hidden layers and more neurons will result in a more accurate AI agent.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is to train the NN. This is done by feeding the NN a large set of data and allowing it to learn from the data. This data should include examples of successful and unsuccessful actions. The NN will then use this data to learn how to make decisions in the game.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3755836/pexels-photo-3755836.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="men-in-white-pants-red-jersey-near-wall"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Once the NN is trained, it can be tested to see how well it performs. This can be done by running the NN against a set of test data and measuring its accuracy. If the accuracy is not satisfactory, the NN can be adjusted and retrained until it performs better.</p><br>
