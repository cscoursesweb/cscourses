                        <p class="article-text">If you’re looking for a way to delete a note from Notes.app using AppleScript, you’ve come to the right place. AppleScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks on your Mac. With AppleScript, you can easily delete a note from Notes.app with just a few lines of code.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Before you can delete a note from Notes.app using AppleScript, you’ll need to make sure that you have the latest version of AppleScript installed on your Mac. You can check this by opening the AppleScript Editor application and selecting “About AppleScript” from the AppleScript menu.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you’ve verified that you have the latest version of AppleScript installed, you’re ready to start writing the code to delete a note from Notes.app. The first step is to open the AppleScript Editor and create a new script. You can do this by selecting “New Script” from the File menu.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you’ve created a new script, you’ll need to add the following code to it:</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/249798/pexels-photo-249798.png?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="full-frame-shot-of-abstract-pattern"><figcaption>picture by Sabrina Gelbart</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">tell application "Notes"</p><br><p class="article-text">end tell</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3819781/pexels-photo-3819781.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-family-sitting-on-floor-while-reading-book"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In this code, you’ll need to replace “Note Title” with the title of the note that you want to delete. Once you’ve done this, you can save the script and run it. This will delete the note from Notes.app.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">It’s important to note that this code will only delete the note from Notes.app. It won’t delete the note from any other applications or services that you may have synced the note to. If you want to delete the note from other applications or services, you’ll need to delete it from those applications or services separately.</p><br>
