                <meta name="description" content="A typical pre-processing and data normalization pipeline for time series data (for non-linear models such as neural networks) involves several steps. First, the data should be split into training and test sets. This allows the model to be trained on the training set and tested on the test set. Next, the data should be normalized, which can be done by scaling the data to a range between 0 and 1. This helps the model to learn more effectively. Finally, the data should be transformed into a format that is suitable for the model. This could involve applying a Fourier transform or a wavelet transform to the data. Once the data is in the correct format, it can be used to train the model.">

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Pre-processing and data normalization are essential steps in the development of any machine learning model, especially for non-linear models such as neural networks. Time series data, which is data collected over a period of time, requires special attention when it comes to pre-processing and data normalization. In this article, we will discuss a typical pre-processing and data normalization pipeline for time series data.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in the pre-processing and data normalization pipeline is to identify and remove any outliers in the data. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data and can have a negative impact on the accuracy of the model. To identify and remove outliers, you can use statistical methods such as the interquartile range or the Z-score.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5846128/pexels-photo-5846128.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-brown-safety-gloves-holding-metal-on-a-drilling-machine"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to transform the data into a stationary series. A stationary series is one in which the mean and variance remain constant over time. To transform the data into a stationary series, you can use techniques such as differencing, log transformation, and seasonal decomposition.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the data is in a stationary form, it is ready for normalization. Normalization is the process of scaling the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is important for neural networks, as it helps the model to converge faster and more accurately. There are several methods for normalizing data, such as min-max scaling, z-score scaling, and robust scaling.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5418935/pexels-photo-5418935.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-in-white-button-up-long-sleeve-dress-holding-clothes-hanger"><figcaption>picture by Arina Krasnikova</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the data is ready for the model. Before feeding the data into the model, it is important to split it into training and test sets. This allows you to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.</p><br>
