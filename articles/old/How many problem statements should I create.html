                <meta name="description" content="When creating a problem statement, it is important to consider the scope of the problem and the resources available to solve it. Generally, it is best to create multiple problem statements to ensure that all aspects of the problem are addressed. Depending on the complexity of the problem, it is recommended to create between three and five problem statements. This will help to ensure that all potential solutions are explored and that the best solution is identified.">

                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to problem statements, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how many you should create. The number of problem statements you should create depends on the scope of the project, the complexity of the problem, and the resources available to you.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">To begin, it’s important to understand what a problem statement is. A problem statement is a concise description of a problem that needs to be solved. It should include the context of the problem, the goal of the project, and the constraints that must be taken into account. Problem statements are used to define the scope of a project and to provide a framework for the project team to work within.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4343030/pexels-photo-4343030.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="people-sitting-on-black-leather-sofa-having-a-conversation"><figcaption>picture by Edmond Dantès</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When it comes to creating problem statements, the number you should create depends on the complexity of the problem. If the problem is relatively simple, then one or two problem statements may be sufficient. However, if the problem is more complex, then you may need to create several problem statements in order to fully define the scope of the project.</p><br><p class="article-text">In addition to the complexity of the problem, the number of problem statements you should create also depends on the resources available to you. If you have a large team of experts working on the project, then you may need to create more problem statements in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page. On the other hand, if you have a small team or limited resources, then you may be able to get away with fewer problem statements.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/897817/pexels-photo-897817.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair"><figcaption>picture by Nathan Cowley</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the number of problem statements you should create also depends on the scope of the project. If the project is relatively small, then one or two problem statements may be sufficient. However, if the project is large and complex, then you may need to create several problem statements in order to fully define the scope of the project.</p><br>
