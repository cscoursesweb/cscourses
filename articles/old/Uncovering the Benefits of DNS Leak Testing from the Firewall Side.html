                        <p class="article-text">DNS Leak Testing is an important security measure for any organization, and it is important to understand the value of testing from both the firewall and the client side. In this article, we will discuss the value of doing DNS Leak Testing directly from a firewall and not just from the client side.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, it is important to understand what DNS Leak Testing is and why it is important. DNS Leak Testing is a process of testing the security of a network by checking for any DNS requests that are being sent outside of the network. This is important because if any requests are being sent outside of the network, it could be a sign of a security breach.</p><br><p class="article-text">When it comes to testing from the firewall, the main benefit is that it can provide a more comprehensive view of the network. By testing from the firewall, you can get a better understanding of the traffic that is going in and out of the network. This can help you identify any potential security issues that may be present.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">On the other hand, testing from the client side can be beneficial as well. By testing from the client side, you can get a better understanding of the traffic that is going in and out of the client’s computer. This can help you identify any potential security issues that may be present on the client’s computer.</p><br>
