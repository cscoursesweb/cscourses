                        <p class="article-text">Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning and data science. It occurs when a model is too complex and has too many parameters, resulting in a model that fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to unseen data. Overfitting can lead to poor performance on unseen data, as the model is unable to accurately predict outcomes for new data points.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">When looking at a model, it can be difficult to determine whether it is overfitting or not. There are a few key indicators that can help you determine if a model is overfitting.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/415829/pexels-photo-415829.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-wearing-black-spaghetti-strap-top"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">First, look at the training and validation accuracy. If the training accuracy is much higher than the validation accuracy, this is a sign that the model is overfitting. This is because the model is fitting the training data too closely, and is not generalizing well to unseen data.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, look at the learning curves. If the training accuracy continues to increase while the validation accuracy plateaus or decreases, this is another sign of overfitting. This is because the model is continuing to fit the training data more and more closely, while not improving its performance on unseen data.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5303649/pexels-photo-5303649.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-boy-reading-a-book"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Third, look at the model complexity. If the model has too many parameters, this can lead to overfitting. This is because the model is trying to fit too many details in the training data, and is not generalizing well to unseen data.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, look at the data. If the data is noisy or has too many outliers, this can lead to overfitting. This is because the model is trying to fit the noise and outliers in the training data, and is not generalizing well to unseen data.</p><br>
