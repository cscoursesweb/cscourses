                        <p class="article-text">The ghost layer is a feature of the popular 3D printing software, Cura. It is a layer that is printed before the actual model, and it is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful. But where did Cura get this ghost layer from?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The ghost layer was first developed by Ultimaker, the company that created Cura. Ultimaker wanted to make 3D printing easier and more reliable, so they developed the ghost layer as a way to help ensure that the model was properly aligned and that the print was successful. The ghost layer is printed before the actual model, and it is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3905451/pexels-photo-3905451.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-and-silver-camera"><figcaption>picture by Tetyana Kovyrina</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The ghost layer is printed using a special type of filament called PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). PVA is a water-soluble filament that is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful. PVA is a special type of filament that is designed to dissolve in water, so it can be easily removed from the model after the print is complete.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The ghost layer is printed using a special type of printer called a dual extruder printer. A dual extruder printer is a type of 3D printer that has two extruders, one for the model and one for the ghost layer. The ghost layer is printed using the second extruder, and it is used to help ensure that the model is properly aligned and that the print is successful.</p><br>
