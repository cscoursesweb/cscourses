        <p class="article-text">Scientific notation is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers in a more compact form. It is commonly used in mathematics, engineering, and science. In scientific notation, a number is written as a coefficient multiplied by 10 raised to a power. For example, the number 1,000,000 can be written in scientific notation as 1 x 106.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8540031/pexels-photo-8540031.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-scientist-drop-pipetting-liquid-samples-in-test-tubes"><figcaption>picture by Karolina Grabowska</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The iPhone has a number of apps that can display scientific notation during calculations.
