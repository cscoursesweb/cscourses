                        <p class="article-text">If you are having trouble getting your player variable set to the car you want, there are a few potential causes that you should consider.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you should make sure that you are correctly setting the variable. Variables are typically set using an assignment operator, such as the equal sign (=). If you are not using the correct operator, then the variable will not be set correctly. Additionally, you should make sure that you are using the correct syntax when setting the variable. For example, if you are setting a string variable, you should make sure that you are enclosing the value in quotation marks.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6347908/pexels-photo-6347908.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="concentrated-latin-american-lady-writing-information-in-notepad-near-netbook"><figcaption>picture by Liza Summer</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Second, you should make sure that you are using the correct data type for the variable. Different data types can store different types of data, and if you are trying to store a car in a variable that is meant to store a number, then the variable will not be set correctly.</p><br><p class="article-text">Third, you should make sure that you are using the correct scope for the variable. Variables can be set in different scopes, such as global, local, or class. If you are trying to set a variable in a scope that it is not meant to be set in, then the variable will not be set correctly.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6090791/pexels-photo-6090791.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-shot-of-a-sniper-rifle"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you should make sure that you are not trying to set the variable to a value that is not allowed. For example, if you are trying to set the variable to a car that does not exist, then the variable will not be set correctly.</p><br>
