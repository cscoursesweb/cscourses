                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to invoicing, it’s important to be as transparent as possible. This includes mentioning any payment gateway charges that may be associated with the transaction. Payment gateway charges are fees that are charged by the payment gateway provider for processing payments. These fees can vary depending on the payment gateway provider and the type of payment being processed.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">In order to accurately mention payment gateway charges in an invoice, you’ll need to know the exact amount of the fee. This information can usually be found in the payment gateway provider’s documentation or on their website. Once you have the exact amount, you can include it in the invoice.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8347501/pexels-photo-8347501.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-in-black-shirt-walking-on-sand"><figcaption>picture by Mo Eid</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When mentioning payment gateway charges in an invoice, it’s important to be clear and concise. You should include the exact amount of the fee, as well as a brief description of what the fee is for. For example, you might include a line item that reads “Payment Gateway Fee: $2.00”. This will make it clear to the customer that they are being charged a fee for using the payment gateway.</p><br><p class="article-text">It’s also important to make sure that the payment gateway fee is clearly separated from the total amount due. This will help to ensure that the customer understands exactly how much they are being charged for the transaction. You can do this by including a separate line item for the payment gateway fee, or by adding a note to the invoice that explains the fee.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6964107/pexels-photo-6964107.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="couple-calculating-all-their-bills"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s important to make sure that the payment gateway fee is included in the total amount due. This will ensure that the customer is aware of the full cost of the transaction, and that they are not being charged more than they should be.</p><br>
