                        <p class="article-text">If you’ve been using your WiFi, Bluetooth, and hotspot without any issues, only to find that they suddenly stopped working, you’re probably wondering what happened. There are a few potential causes for this issue, and it’s important to identify the root of the problem in order to get your devices back up and running.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The most common cause of WiFi, Bluetooth, and hotspot issues is a problem with your router or modem. If your router or modem is malfunctioning, it can cause all of these services to stop working. To check if this is the issue, try unplugging your router or modem and plugging it back in. If this doesn’t work, you may need to reset your router or modem.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3778145/pexels-photo-3778145.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-in-white-long-sleeve-sketching-on-white-cardboard"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another potential cause of these issues is a problem with your device’s settings. If you’ve recently changed any settings on your device, such as the WiFi network name or password, this could be the cause of the problem. To fix this, you’ll need to reset your device’s settings to their original state.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you’ve recently installed any new software or apps on your device, this could also be the cause of the issue. Some software or apps can interfere with your device’s WiFi, Bluetooth, and hotspot settings, so it’s important to check if any new software or apps are the cause of the problem. If so, you may need to uninstall the software or app in order to get your services back up and running.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-programming-of-codes"><figcaption>picture by luis gomes</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if none of the above solutions work, you may need to update your device’s firmware. Firmware updates can fix a variety of issues, including WiFi, Bluetooth, and hotspot problems. To update your device’s firmware, you’ll need to check your device’s manufacturer website for instructions.</p><br>
