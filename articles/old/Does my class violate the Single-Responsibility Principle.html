It will discuss the concept of SRP, its importance, and provide examples of classes that do and do not violate the principle. Additionally, it will provide guidance on how to refactor a class to adhere to the SRP. Finally, it will provide resources for further reading on the topic.">

                        <p class="article-text">The Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a fundamental concept in software engineering that states that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have only one responsibility and that responsibility should be encapsulated within the class. The SRP is an important part of object-oriented programming and is often used to help create maintainable and extensible code.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">So, does your class violate the Single-Responsibility Principle? The answer to this question depends on the specifics of your class. Generally speaking, if your class is responsible for more than one thing, then it is likely violating the SRP. For example, if your class is responsible for both data storage and data manipulation, then it is likely violating the SRP.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/117729/pexels-photo-117729.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="black-internal-hdd-on-black-surface"><figcaption>picture by Azamat Esenaliev</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">To determine if your class is violating the SRP, you should first consider the purpose of the class. What is the class responsible for? If the class is responsible for more than one thing, then it is likely violating the SRP.</p><br><p class="article-text">Next, you should consider the structure of the class. Does the class contain multiple methods that are responsible for different tasks? If so, then it is likely violating the SRP.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8436655/pexels-photo-8436655.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="men-and-women-rolling-yoga-mats-on-the-floor"><figcaption>picture by Yan Krukau</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you should consider the scope of the class. Is the class responsible for tasks that are outside of its scope? If so, then it is likely violating the SRP.</p><br>
