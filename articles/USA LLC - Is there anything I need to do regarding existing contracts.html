                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to forming a USA LLC, there are a few things to consider when it comes to existing contracts. Depending on the type of contract, you may need to take certain steps to ensure that the LLC is legally bound to the contract.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, it is important to understand the type of contract you are dealing with. If the contract is with an individual, then the LLC will need to be listed as the contracting party. This means that the LLC will need to be registered with the state and the individual will need to sign the contract in the name of the LLC.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/955389/pexels-photo-955389.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-holding-gray-twist-pen-and-white-printer-paper-on-brown-wooden-table"><figcaption>picture by Cytonn Photography</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If the contract is with a business, then the LLC will need to be listed as the contracting party. This means that the LLC will need to be registered with the state and the business will need to sign the contract in the name of the LLC.</p><br><p class="article-text">In either case, it is important to make sure that the LLC is listed as the contracting party. This will ensure that the LLC is legally bound to the contract and that any disputes or issues that arise will be handled in the name of the LLC.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/563067/pexels-photo-563067.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="round-gray-bowl"><figcaption>picture by jamie he</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">It is also important to make sure that the LLC is listed as the owner of any assets or property that are part of the contract. This will ensure that the LLC is the legal owner of the assets or property and that any disputes or issues that arise will be handled in the name of the LLC.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is important to make sure that the LLC is listed as the responsible party for any liabilities or obligations that are part of the contract. This will ensure that the LLC is legally responsible for any liabilities or obligations that arise from the contract and that any disputes or issues that arise will be handled in the name of the LLC.</p><br>
