<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Automatic portfolio rebalancing is a process of regularly adjusting the asset allocation of an investment portfolio to maintain its original risk/return profile. It is a strategy used by investors to ensure that their portfolios remain in line with their desired risk/return objectives. The goal of automatic portfolio rebalancing is to reduce the risk of an investor’s portfolio becoming too heavily weighted in one asset class or another, while also helping to maximize returns.</p>
<p>The process of automatic portfolio rebalancing involves periodically reviewing and adjusting the asset allocation of an investment portfolio. This can be done manually or through automated software programs. When done manually, the investor will review their current holdings and make adjustments as needed to bring them back into alignment with their desired risk/return objectives. When done through automated software programs, the program will automatically adjust the asset allocation based on predetermined criteria set by the investor.</p>			
<h3>Why Should You Rebalance Your Portfolio?</h3>
<p>Rebalancing your portfolio is important for several reasons. First, it helps you maintain your desired level of risk/return objectives by ensuring that your investments are not too heavily weighted in one asset class or another. Second, it helps you take advantage of market opportunities by allowing you to buy low and sell high when necessary. Third, it helps you manage taxes more efficiently by allowing you to harvest losses when appropriate and defer gains when possible. Finally, it helps you stay disciplined and focused on your long-term goals by forcing you to review your investments periodically and make adjustments as needed.</p>

<h3>How Often Should You Rebalance Your Portfolio?</h3>
<p>The frequency with which you should rebalance your portfolio depends on several factors including your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance level. Generally speaking, most investors should aim to rebalance their portfolios at least once per year or whenever their allocations drift more than 5% from their target allocations. However, some investors may choose to rebalance more frequently depending on their individual circumstances and goals.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing</h3>
<p>Automatic portfolio rebalancing offers several benefits over manual rebalancing including convenience, cost savings, and improved discipline. By automating the process of rebalancing your investments, you can save time and money that would otherwise be spent manually reviewing and adjusting your holdings each year or whenever they drift from their target allocations. Additionally, automating this process can help improve discipline by forcing you to review your investments periodically even if you don’t have the time or inclination to do so manually each year or whenever they drift from their target allocations.</p>
<p>Overall, automatic portfolio rebalancing is a great way for investors to ensure that their portfolios remain in line with their desired risk/return objectives while also taking advantage of market opportunities when available and managing taxes more efficiently when possible. By automating this process investors can save time and money while also improving discipline which can help them stay focused on achieving long-term success with their investmentsI highly recommend exploring these related articles, which will provide valuable insights and help you gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.:<a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/benefits%20of%20automatic%20rebalancing%20portfolio.html'>www.cscourses.dev/benefits-of-automatic-rebalancing-portfolio.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/do%20nvidia%20drivers%20update%20automatically.html'>www.cscourses.dev/do-nvidia-drivers-update-automatically.html</a>, <a href='https://www.cscourses.dev/articles/should%20i%20enable%20automatic%20tuning%20nvidia.html'>www.cscourses.dev/should-i-enable-automatic-tuning-nvidia.html</a></p>
