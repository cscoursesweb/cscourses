        <p class="article-text">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly popular, with many companies and organizations investing in the technology. One of the most talked-about AI applications is natural language processing (NLP), which is used to create chatbots and other conversational AI systems. Two of the most popular NLP systems are ChatGPT and GPT 3. But are they the same?</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9241723/pexels-photo-9241723.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-people-woman-girl"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">ChatGPT is an open-source NLP system developed by Microsoft. It is based on the Transformer architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that uses attention mechanisms to process text. ChatGPT is designed to generate natural-sounding conversations, and it can be used to create chatbots and other conversational AI systems.</p><br><p class="article-text">GPT 3, on the other hand, is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on a deep learning architecture called a transformer, which is similar to the one used in ChatGPT. GPT 3 is designed to generate human-like text, and it can be used to create natural language processing applications such as question-answering systems and text summarization.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4145146/pexels-photo-4145146.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-child-sitting-on-chair-while-holding-tablet"><figcaption>picture by Julia M Cameron</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">So, are ChatGPT and GPT 3 the same? The answer is no. While both systems are based on the same deep learning architecture, they are designed for different purposes. ChatGPT is designed to generate natural-sounding conversations, while GPT 3 is designed to generate human-like text. Additionally, ChatGPT is open-source, while GPT 3 is proprietary.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">That said, both systems can be used to create conversational AI systems. For example, GPT 3 can be used to create chatbots that generate natural-sounding conversations. Similarly, ChatGPT can be used to create question-answering systems and text summarization applications.</p><br>
