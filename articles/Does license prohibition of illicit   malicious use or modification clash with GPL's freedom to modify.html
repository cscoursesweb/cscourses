                <title>Does license prohibition of illicit / malicious use or modification clash with GPL's freedom to modify?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used open source software license that grants users the freedom to modify and redistribute software. However, this freedom to modify can sometimes clash with the license prohibition of illicit or malicious use or modification. In this article, we will explore the tension between the GPL’s freedom to modify and the prohibition of illicit or malicious use or modification, and discuss how this tension can be resolved. We will also look at the implications of this tension for developers and users of open source software.">

                        <p class="article-text">The General Public License (GPL) is a widely used open source software license that grants users the freedom to modify and redistribute the software. This freedom is a cornerstone of the open source movement, and has been a major factor in the success of many open source projects. However, the GPL also contains provisions that prohibit the use or modification of the software for illicit or malicious purposes. This raises the question: does the license prohibition of illicit or malicious use or modification clash with the GPL’s freedom to modify?</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question is both yes and no. On the one hand, the GPL does not explicitly prohibit the use or modification of the software for illicit or malicious purposes. The GPL does not contain any language that explicitly states that users are prohibited from using or modifying the software for such purposes. This means that, in theory, users are free to use or modify the software for any purpose, including illicit or malicious purposes.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/88630/pexels-photo-88630.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-car-parking-on-the-road-at-daytime"><figcaption>picture by Albert Nunez</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">On the other hand, the GPL does contain language that implies that users should not use or modify the software for illicit or malicious purposes. For example, the GPL states that users must “not attempt to restrict others’ use of the program” and “not use the program for any illegal purpose.” This language implies that users should not use or modify the software for any purpose that is illegal or otherwise unethical.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition, the GPL also contains language that allows the copyright holder to take legal action against users who use or modify the software for illicit or malicious purposes. For example, the GPL states that the copyright holder may “take legal action against any party who, without authorization, uses the program or any part of it, either modified or unmodified.” This language implies that the copyright holder may take legal action against users who use or modify the software for illicit or malicious purposes.</p><br>
