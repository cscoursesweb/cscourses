                <title>Does license prohibition of illicit / malicious use or modification clash with GPL's freedom to modify?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used open source software license that grants users the freedom to modify and redistribute software. However, this freedom is not without limits. The GPL also prohibits the use or modification of software for illicit or malicious purposes. This prohibition can sometimes clash with the GPL's freedom to modify, as users may be restricted from making certain modifications to the software. In this article, we will explore the tension between the GPL's freedom to modify and its prohibition of illicit or malicious use or modification. We will discuss the implications of this tension and how it can be addressed.">

                        <p class="article-text">The General Public License (GPL) is a widely used open source software license that grants users the freedom to modify and redistribute the software. This freedom is a cornerstone of the open source movement, and has been a major factor in the success of many open source projects. However, this freedom to modify can sometimes clash with the prohibition of illicit or malicious use or modification of the software.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The GPL explicitly states that users are free to modify the software as they see fit, as long as they comply with the terms of the license. This includes the right to modify the software for any purpose, including malicious or illicit purposes. This freedom to modify is a key part of the GPL, and is essential to the open source movement.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/109998/pexels-photo-109998.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="yellow-and-teal-open-neon-signage"><figcaption>picture by Ben Taylor</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">At the same time, the GPL also prohibits the use or modification of the software for any illicit or malicious purpose. This prohibition is designed to protect the integrity of the software, and to ensure that it is not used for any illegal or unethical activities.</p><br><p class="article-text">The tension between these two aspects of the GPL can be difficult to reconcile. On the one hand, the GPL grants users the freedom to modify the software as they see fit. On the other hand, it also prohibits the use or modification of the software for any illicit or malicious purpose.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11540999/pexels-photo-11540999.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="volkswagen-steering-wheel"><figcaption>picture by Rama Rafael Phangestu</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The best way to reconcile this tension is to ensure that users are aware of the terms of the GPL, and that they understand the implications of modifying the software for any illicit or malicious purpose. Users should be aware that any modifications they make to the software may be subject to legal action if they are found to be in violation of the GPL.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition, it is important for users to be aware of the potential consequences of using or modifying the software for any illicit or malicious purpose. This includes the potential for legal action, as well as the potential for damage to the software or to the reputation of the open source project.</p><br>
