        <p class="article-text">If you’ve ever seen a notification icon on your phone or computer and wondered what app it belongs to, you’re not alone. With so many apps available, it can be difficult to keep track of which icon belongs to which app. Fortunately, there are a few ways to figure out what app has this notification icon.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5182237/pexels-photo-5182237.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-demonstrating-modern-electronic-wristwatch"><figcaption>picture by Erik Mclean</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first step is to look closely at the icon. Many apps have unique icons that are easy to recognize. For example, the Facebook icon is a blue square with a white “f” in the center. If you can’t recognize the icon, try searching for it online. You can use a reverse image search to find out what app the icon belongs to.</p><br><p class="article-text">If you’re still having trouble, you can try looking at the notification itself. Many notifications will include the name of the app or a link to the app’s website. If the notification doesn’t include this information, you can try searching for the text of the notification online. This can help you find out what app the notification is from.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2265482/pexels-photo-2265482.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-sitting-beside-table-while-using-ipad"><figcaption>picture by Marek Levak</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re still having trouble, you can try asking your friends or family. Chances are, someone you know has seen the same icon and can tell you what app it belongs to.</p><br>
