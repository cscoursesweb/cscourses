                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that focuses on teaching agents to make decisions in an environment by rewarding them for good behavior and punishing them for bad behavior. Graph-structured environments are a type of environment that can be used in RL, and they are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to represent complex relationships between states and actions. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common graph-structured environments for use in reinforcement learning.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">One of the most popular graph-structured environments for use in reinforcement learning is the Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs are a type of graph-structured environment that represent the states, actions, and rewards of a system. In an MDP, each state is represented by a node in the graph, and each action is represented by an edge connecting two nodes. The rewards associated with each action are represented by the weights of the edges. MDPs are useful for reinforcement learning because they allow agents to learn from their environment by exploring different paths and discovering the rewards associated with each action.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/590011/pexels-photo-590011.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-printer-paper"><figcaption>picture by Lukas</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another popular graph-structured environment for use in reinforcement learning is the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). POMDPs are similar to MDPs, but they are more complex because they allow agents to make decisions based on partial information. In a POMDP, the environment is represented by a graph, and each node represents a state. The edges represent the actions that can be taken in each state, and the weights of the edges represent the rewards associated with each action. POMDPs are useful for reinforcement learning because they allow agents to make decisions based on incomplete information, which is often the case in real-world environments.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, another popular graph-structured environment for use in reinforcement learning is the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environment. MARL environments are similar to MDPs and POMDPs, but they are more complex because they involve multiple agents interacting with each other in the environment. In a MARL environment, each agent is represented by a node in the graph, and the edges represent the actions that can be taken by each agent. The weights of the edges represent the rewards associated with each action. MARL environments are useful for reinforcement learning because they allow agents to learn from each other and cooperate to achieve a common goal.</p><br>
