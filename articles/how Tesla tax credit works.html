<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Tesla tax credit is a federal incentive that allows electric vehicle owners to receive a tax credit for purchasing an eligible Tesla vehicle. This credit can be used to reduce the amount of taxes you owe, or it can be refunded if you don’t owe any taxes. The amount of the credit varies depending on the model and year of your Tesla, but it can be up to $7,500.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for the Tesla tax credit, you must purchase a new or used Tesla vehicle that was manufactured after January 1st, 2017. The vehicle must also be registered in your name and used primarily for personal use. Additionally, you must have purchased the vehicle from an authorized dealer in order to qualify for the credit.</p>

<h3>How Does the Tesla Tax Credit Work?</h3>
<p>The Tesla tax credit works by reducing your federal income tax liability dollar-for-dollar. For example, if you purchase a new Model 3 and are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, then your federal income tax liability will be reduced by $7,500. This means that if you owe $10,000 in taxes before taking advantage of the credit, then after taking advantage of it you will only owe $2,500 in taxes.</p>
<p>The amount of the credit is based on the model and year of your Tesla vehicle. For example, if you purchase a new Model 3 in 2020 then you will be eligible for a full $7,500 tax credit; however if you purchase a used Model S from 2017 then you will only be eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. Additionally, if multiple people are listed as owners on the title then they will both receive half of the total available credits (e.g., two people listed as owners on a new Model 3 would each receive $3,750).</p>

<h3>Claiming Your Tax Credit</h3>
<p>Once you have purchased an eligible Tesla vehicle and registered it in your name then you can begin claiming your tax credits by filing Form 8936 with your federal income taxes each year. On this form you will need to provide information about yourself (name/address/social security number) as well as information about your vehicle (make/model/year). Once this form is completed and submitted with your taxes then your credits will be applied automatically when they are processed by the IRS.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that these credits are not refundable; meaning that they cannot exceed what you owe in taxes each year. If this happens then any remaining credits will carry over into future years until they are fully utilized or expire after five years (whichever comes first). Additionally, these credits cannot be transferred between individuals or vehicles; meaning that once they are claimed by one person they cannot be claimed again by another person or applied to another vehicle even if it is owned by the same person who originally claimed them.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Tesla tax credit is an excellent way for electric vehicle owners to save money on their federal income taxes each year. By understanding how this incentive works and following all applicable rules and regulations when claiming it on their taxes each year electric car owners can maximize their savings while helping reduce their environmental impact at the same time!</p>
