                <title>How to handle the size difference of highway network or residual network in cnn?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="When dealing with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it is important to consider the size difference between the highway network and the residual network. The highway network is typically larger than the residual network, and this size difference can cause issues when training the network. In this article, we will discuss how to handle the size difference between the highway network and the residual network in a CNN. We will cover topics such as data pre-processing, network architecture, and optimization techniques. Finally, we will provide some tips for ensuring that the size difference between the two networks does not cause any issues during training.">

                        <p class="article-text">The size difference between highway networks and residual networks in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be a tricky issue to handle. In this article, we will discuss the various ways to address this issue and how to best manage the size difference between the two networks.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, it is important to understand the differences between highway networks and residual networks. Highway networks are a type of neural network that uses a series of layers to process data. The layers are connected by a series of weights, which are adjusted to optimize the network’s performance. Residual networks, on the other hand, are a type of neural network that uses a series of layers to process data, but the layers are connected by a series of shortcuts. These shortcuts allow the network to learn more quickly and accurately.</p><br><p class="article-text">Now that we understand the differences between the two networks, let’s discuss how to handle the size difference. The most common way to address this issue is to use a technique called “resizing”. This involves adjusting the size of the layers in the network so that they are the same size. This can be done manually or with the help of a software program.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another way to handle the size difference is to use a technique called “padding”. This involves adding additional layers to the network so that the size of the layers is the same. This can be done manually or with the help of a software program.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8192142/pexels-photo-8192142.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="red-sequence-on-sanitary-pads-on-a-purple-surface"><figcaption>picture by Ann Zzz</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it is also possible to use a technique called “striding”. This involves adjusting the stride of the layers in the network so that they are the same size. This can be done manually or with the help of a software program.</p><br>
