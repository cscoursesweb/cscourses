        <p class="article-text">STL (Standard Tessellation Language) files are used to create 3D models for 3D printing, computer-aided design (CAD) and other 3D applications. STL files are composed of triangles, which are the most basic shapes in 3D modeling. Modifying STL files can be a difficult and time-consuming task, but there are a number of tools available to help make the process easier.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6693655/pexels-photo-6693655.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-laptop-near-the-dollars-and-papers-on-a-wooden-table"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">One of the most popular tools for modifying STLs is Meshmixer. Meshmixer is a free 3D modeling software developed by Autodesk. It is designed to help users quickly and easily modify STL files. Meshmixer has a wide range of features, including the ability to add, delete, and move triangles, as well as the ability to combine multiple STL files into one. Meshmixer also has a number of advanced features, such as the ability to create hollow objects, add textures, and create 3D prints from STL files.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another popular tool for modifying STLs is Blender. Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite. It is used for 3D modeling, animation, rendering, and more. Blender has a wide range of features, including the ability to add, delete, and move triangles, as well as the ability to combine multiple STL files into one. Blender also has a number of advanced features, such as the ability to create hollow objects, add textures, and create 3D prints from STL files.</p><br>
