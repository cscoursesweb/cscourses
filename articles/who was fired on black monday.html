<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Black Monday is the name given to the stock market crash of October 19, 1987. On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 22.6%, making it the largest one-day percentage drop in history. The crash was caused by a combination of factors, including overvaluation of stocks, high levels of debt, and a large sell-off of stocks by institutional investors. The crash had a significant impact on the global economy and financial markets, leading to a recession in many countries.</p>			
<h3>Who Was Fired on Black Monday?</h3>
<p>The crash of Black Monday had far-reaching consequences for many people involved in the financial markets. Many traders and brokers were fired as a result of their losses during the crash. Some firms went bankrupt due to their losses, while others were forced to downsize or restructure their operations. In addition, some executives were fired for their role in contributing to the crash or for failing to take appropriate action to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>One example is John Phelan Jr., who was chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange at the time of Black Monday. He was fired shortly after the crash due to his failure to take action that could have prevented it from happening. He was replaced by Richard Grasso, who implemented reforms that helped restore investor confidence in the stock market and prevent similar crashes from occurring in future years.</p>
<p>Another example is Robert Stovall, who was president of Dean Witter Reynolds at the time of Black Monday. He was fired shortly after the crash due to his failure to take appropriate action during it and his lack of foresight in predicting its occurrence. His replacement was John Gutfreund, who implemented reforms that helped restore investor confidence in Dean Witter Reynolds and other Wall Street firms following Black Monday's aftermath.</p>

<h3>What Were The Consequences Of Those Who Were Fired?</h3>
<p>The consequences for those who were fired as a result of Black Monday were severe both professionally and personally. Professionally, they lost their jobs and reputations as successful traders or executives on Wall Street; many found it difficult or impossible to find new positions within finance after being fired from their previous ones due to their association with Black Monday's losses.</p>
<p>On a personal level, those who were fired often experienced feelings of shame and guilt over their role in contributing to or failing to prevent such a catastrophic event from occurring; some even suffered depression or anxiety as a result of being blamed for something they had no control over. In addition, many faced financial hardship due to losing their jobs; some had difficulty finding new employment that paid enough money for them to support themselves and their families while others had difficulty paying off debts incurred during their time working on Wall Street prior to being fired on Black Monday.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned From Those Who Were Fired On Black Monday</h3>
<p>The events surrounding those who were fired on Black Monday serve as an important lesson about risk management within finance and investing: always be prepared for unexpected events that could have an adverse effect on your investments or business operations; never assume that past performance will guarantee future success; always be aware of potential risks associated with any investment decision you make; never invest more than you can afford to lose; always diversify your investments across different asset classes; and always be prepared with an exit strategy should things go wrong with any particular investment decision you make.</p>
<p>In addition, those who were fired on Black Monday serve as an important reminder about how quickly fortunes can change within finance: no matter how successful you may be today, there is no guarantee that your success will continue into tomorrow if you fail to take appropriate action when necessary or if unexpected events occur beyond your control which could have an adverse effect on your investments or business operations.
