                <title>Why do we need convolutions over volume in convolutional neural networks for image recognition?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a powerful tool for image recognition, and convolutions over volume are an essential part of this process. Convolutional layers are used to detect patterns in images, and the convolutional operation is used to extract features from the input image. By applying convolutions over volume, CNNs can identify objects in an image, even if they are rotated or scaled. This is because the convolutional layers are able to detect patterns in the image regardless of the orientation or size of the object. Additionally, convolutions over volume allow CNNs to detect more complex patterns in the image, such as edges, shapes, and textures. This makes them more accurate and reliable for image recognition tasks.">

                        <p class="article-text">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that are used for image recognition. They are based on the concept of convolution, which is a mathematical operation that takes two functions and produces a third function that describes the relationship between the two. In CNNs, convolution is used to extract features from an image, which are then used to classify the image.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Convolutional neural networks use convolutional layers to process images. Each layer consists of a set of filters, which are used to detect features in the image. The filters are applied to the image in a sliding window fashion, where the filter is moved across the image in a certain direction. As the filter moves, it extracts features from the image, such as edges, shapes, and textures.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8375106/pexels-photo-8375106.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="cocktails-on-shot-glasses"><figcaption>picture by Denys Gromov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The convolutional layers are then followed by a pooling layer, which is used to reduce the size of the feature maps. This is done by taking the maximum or average value of the feature maps in a certain region. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed, which makes the network more efficient.</p><br><p class="article-text">The convolutional layers and pooling layers are then followed by a fully connected layer, which is used to classify the image. This layer takes the features extracted by the convolutional layers and uses them to make a prediction about the image.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12159262/pexels-photo-12159262.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="abstract-art-of-layered-colors"><figcaption>picture by Susan Wilkinson</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">So why do we need convolutions over volume in convolutional neural networks for image recognition? The answer is that convolutions are used to extract features from an image, which are then used to classify the image. Without convolutions, the network would not be able to detect the features in the image, which would make it difficult to classify the image accurately.</p><br><p class="article-text">Convolutions are also used to reduce the size of the feature maps, which makes the network more efficient. This is important because the larger the feature maps, the more data needs to be processed, which can slow down the network.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, convolutions are used to make the network more robust. By using convolutions, the network can detect features in the image even if the image is rotated or scaled. This makes the network more reliable and accurate.</p><br>
