<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the world of real estate, Zillow is one of the most popular websites for finding homes and getting an estimate of their value. But recently, many people have been asking if Zillow has changed their algorithm. This article will explore this question and provide some insight into how Zillow works and what changes they may have made to their algorithm.</p>			
<h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
<p>An algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task. In the case of Zillow, their algorithm is used to determine the estimated value of a home based on various factors such as location, size, amenities, etc. The algorithm takes all these factors into account and then provides an estimated value for the home.</p>

<h3>How Does Zillow's Algorithm Work?</h3>
<p>Zillow's algorithm takes into account several different factors when determining the estimated value of a home. These include things like location, size, amenities, condition of the home, recent sales in the area, and more. All these factors are taken into account and then used to generate an estimated value for the home.</p>

<h3>Has Zillow Changed Their Algorithm?</h3>
<p>It is difficult to say definitively whether or not Zillow has changed their algorithm recently as they do not publicly disclose this information. However, there are some indications that they may have made some changes in recent months. For example, some users have reported that their estimates have changed significantly in recent months without any obvious explanation as to why this might be happening. Additionally, there have been reports that suggest that Zillow may be using new data sources or different methods for calculating estimates which could indicate changes to their algorithm.</p>

<h3>What Does This Mean For Homeowners?</h3>
<p>If Zillow has indeed changed their algorithm recently then it could mean that homeowners may see different estimates for their homes than they did previously. This could be beneficial or detrimental depending on how much the estimate has changed and what other factors are influencing it such as recent sales in the area or changes in market conditions. It is important for homeowners to keep an eye on their estimates so they can make sure they are getting accurate information about their home's value.</p>
<p>Overall, it appears that there may have been some changes made to Zillow's algorithm recently but it is difficult to say definitively without more information from them about what those changes were and how they might affect homeowners' estimates of their homes' values. Homeowners should keep an eye on their estimates so they can make sure they are getting accurate information about their home's value and take any necessary steps if needed.</p>
