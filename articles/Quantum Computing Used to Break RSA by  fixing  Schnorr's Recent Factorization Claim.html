We will discuss how quantum computing can be used to break RSA encryption by exploiting Schnorr's recent factorization claim. We will also discuss the potential implications of this development and the steps that can be taken to protect against quantum computing attacks. Finally, we will look at the future of quantum computing and its potential impact on cryptography.">

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Quantum computing has been a hot topic in the tech world for some time now, and its potential applications are vast. One of the most exciting possibilities is the potential to break RSA, the most widely used public-key cryptography system. Recently, a team of researchers from the University of Bristol and the University of Bristol's Centre for Quantum Technologies have claimed to have broken RSA using quantum computing.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The team used a technique called “Schnorr’s factorization claim” to break RSA. This technique is based on the fact that RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. By using a quantum computer, the team was able to factor large numbers much faster than is possible with traditional computers. This allowed them to break RSA and decrypt messages that were encrypted using the system.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3831873/pexels-photo-3831873.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="serious-female-office-worker-using-printer-in-workplace"><figcaption>picture by Andrea Piacquadio</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The team’s breakthrough is significant because it shows that quantum computing can be used to break RSA. This means that any system that relies on RSA for security could be vulnerable to attack. However, the team was quick to point out that their breakthrough does not mean that RSA is now obsolete.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">The team also noted that their breakthrough does not mean that quantum computing can be used to break all encryption systems. In fact, the team believes that their breakthrough could actually be used to improve the security of RSA. They suggest that by “fixing” Schnorr’s factorization claim, it could be possible to make RSA more secure against quantum computing attacks.</p><br>
