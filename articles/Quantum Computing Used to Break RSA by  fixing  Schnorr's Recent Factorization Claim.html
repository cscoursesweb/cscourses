                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="article-text">Quantum computing has been a hot topic in the tech world for some time now, and its potential to revolutionize computing is undeniable. Recently, researchers have been exploring the possibility of using quantum computing to break RSA, a widely used public-key cryptography system. In particular, a team of researchers from the University of Bristol have claimed to have successfully used quantum computing to “fix” Schnorr’s recent factorization claim.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Schnorr’s factorization claim is a mathematical problem that involves factoring a large number into its prime factors. This problem is believed to be difficult to solve using classical computing, and it is the basis of RSA’s security. However, the team of researchers from the University of Bristol have claimed to have used quantum computing to solve the problem.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14650435/pexels-photo-14650435.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="aerial-suburban-image"><figcaption>picture by Geometric Photography</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The team used a quantum computer to factor a large number into its prime factors. This was done by using a technique called Shor’s algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm that can be used to factor large numbers. The team then used the factors to “fix” Schnorr’s factorization claim.</p><br><p class="article-text">The team’s research has been met with some skepticism, as it is not yet clear how the team was able to use quantum computing to break RSA. However, the team’s research does suggest that quantum computing could be used to break RSA in the future.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8727519/pexels-photo-8727519.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-a-man-with-facial-hair"><figcaption>picture by Tima Miroshnichenko</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">The team’s research is an important step forward in the field of quantum computing, and it could have far-reaching implications for the security of public-key cryptography systems. If quantum computing can be used to break RSA, then it could potentially be used to break other public-key cryptography systems as well.</p><br>
