                        <p class="article-text">Creating a placeholder for an image URL is a great way to improve the user experience on your website. It allows users to quickly see what an image looks like without having to wait for the entire image to load. This can be especially useful for large images that take a long time to download. Fortunately, there is a way to fetch only the first few bytes of an image URL to create a placeholder.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to determine the size of the image you want to use as a placeholder. This will determine how many bytes you need to fetch. Generally, a small image of around 100x100 pixels is a good size for a placeholder. Once you have determined the size, you can use a tool like ImageMagick to determine the exact number of bytes you need to fetch.</p><br><p class="article-text">Next, you need to find the URL of the image you want to use as a placeholder. This can be done by right-clicking on the image and selecting “Copy Image Address”. Once you have the URL, you can use a tool like cURL to fetch the first few bytes of the image. To do this, you will need to specify the number of bytes you want to fetch. For example, if you want to fetch the first 100 bytes of an image, you would use the following command:</p><br><p class="article-text">curl -r 0-99 <image_url></p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/38544/imac-apple-mockup-app-38544.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="apple-office-internet-ipad"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have fetched the first few bytes of the image, you can use them to create a placeholder. This can be done by creating an HTML image tag and setting the source to the URL of the image. You can also set the width and height of the image to the size of the placeholder you want to create. For example, if you want to create a placeholder of 100x100 pixels, you would use the following code:</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text"><img src="<image_url>" width="100" height="100"></p><br>
                    </div>
