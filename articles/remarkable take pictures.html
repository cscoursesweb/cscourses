<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Taking pictures with the reMarkable 2 is a great way to capture memories and document special moments. The reMarkable 2 is a paper tablet that replaces your notebooks and printed documents with a 10.3" display. It is 4.7 mm thin and weighs 403.5 g, making it easy to carry around and take pictures with. It has 8 GB internal storage, 1 GB LPDDR3 SDRAM, and runs on a 1.2 GHz dual-core ARM processor with a custom Linux-based OS. The tablet supports PDF and ePUB file formats and features palm rejection, so you can take pictures without worrying about smudging the screen or leaving fingerprints behind. It has no backlight and charges via USB-C, so you don’t have to worry about running out of battery power while taking pictures. It also automatically syncs to your phone and computer with the reMarkable cloud service, so you can easily share your photos with friends and family.</p>			
<h3>Understanding the Camera Settings</h3>
<p>The first step in taking remarkable pictures with the reMarkable 2 is understanding how to use its camera settings. The camera settings are located in the top right corner of the screen when you open up the camera app on your tablet. You can adjust things like exposure, white balance, ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, focus mode, flash mode, image size, image quality, metering mode, color effects, scene modes, and more depending on what type of picture you’re trying to take.</p>
<p>For example if you’re trying to take a picture of something far away or in low light conditions then you might want to increase your ISO sensitivity or adjust your shutter speed accordingly so that more light can enter into the lens of your camera for a better picture quality overall. If you’re trying to take a portrait then you might want to adjust your focus mode so that it focuses on one particular subject instead of everything else in the background which could be distracting from your main subject matter in the photo itself.</p>

<h3>Using Filters for More Creative Photos</h3>
<p>Another great way to take remarkable pictures with the reMarkable 2 is by using filters for more creative photos. Filters are great because they allow you to add different effects or colors onto your photos which can make them look more interesting or unique compared to other photos taken without any filters at all. The reMarkable 2 comes preloaded with several different filters such as black & white filter which will turn any photo into black & white; sepia filter which will give any photo an old-fashioned look; vintage filter which will give any photo an aged look; HDR filter which will enhance details in shadows & highlights; night vision filter which will make any photo look like it was taken at night; and many more!</p>
