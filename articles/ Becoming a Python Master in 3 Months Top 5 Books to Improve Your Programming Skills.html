<h3>2. Learn Python 3 the Hard Way</h3>
<p>Learn Python 3 the Hard Way is another great resource for beginners who want to learn how to program in Python from scratch. Written by Zed Shaw, this book takes a hands-on approach that encourages readers to type out each example code themselves instead of simply reading about it or watching someone else do it on video tutorials. This approach helps readers understand how each line of code works and why it’s important instead of just memorizing syntax without understanding its purpose or application.</p>

<h3>3. Fluent Python</h3>
<p>Fluent Python is an excellent resource for intermediate-level programmers who want to take their skills up a notch by learning more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). Written by Luciano Ramalho, this book covers topics such as data structures, algorithms, metaprogramming, concurrency, and more in detail so readers can gain a deeper understanding of how these concepts work together in real-world applications.</p>			
<h3>4. Effective Computation in Physics</h3>
<p>Effective Computation in Physics is an ideal resource for scientists who want to use Python for scientific computing tasks such as numerical simulations or data analysis projects. Written by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Dolan, this book covers topics such as numerical integration techniques, linear algebra operations with NumPy arrays, plotting data with matplotlib library functions, debugging code using IPython notebooks, and more so readers can gain a better understanding of how these concepts apply when working on scientific computing projects with Python.</p>
