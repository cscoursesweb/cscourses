                        <p class="article-text">The Raspberry Pi is a popular choice for running Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers. However, there are other viable substitutes that can be used to run the same software. In this article, we will discuss some of the alternatives to the Raspberry Pi that can be used to run Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first alternative to the Raspberry Pi is the BeagleBone Black. This is a single-board computer that is similar to the Raspberry Pi but has more powerful hardware. It has a 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8 processor, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of onboard storage. It also has a micro HDMI port, USB ports, and an Ethernet port. The BeagleBone Black is a great choice for running Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers because it has more powerful hardware than the Raspberry Pi.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12169613/pexels-photo-12169613.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-blue-and-black-abstract-art"><figcaption>picture by Susan Wilkinson</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second alternative to the Raspberry Pi is the Odroid XU4. This is a single-board computer that is similar to the Raspberry Pi but has more powerful hardware. It has an octa-core ARM Cortex-A15 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of onboard storage. It also has a micro HDMI port, USB ports, and an Ethernet port. The Odroid XU4 is a great choice for running Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers because it has more powerful hardware than the Raspberry Pi.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third alternative to the Raspberry Pi is the ASUS Tinker Board. This is a single-board computer that is similar to the Raspberry Pi but has more powerful hardware. It has a 1.8GHz ARM Cortex-A17 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of onboard storage. It also has a micro HDMI port, USB ports, and an Ethernet port. The ASUS Tinker Board is a great choice for running Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers because it has more powerful hardware than the Raspberry Pi.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12638962/pexels-photo-12638962.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-jumping-on-board-kitesurfing-at-sea"><figcaption>picture by All Good</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fourth alternative to the Raspberry Pi is the Odroid C2. This is a single-board computer that is similar to the Raspberry Pi but has more powerful hardware. It has an octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of onboard storage. It also has a micro HDMI port, USB ports, and an Ethernet port. The Odroid C2 is a great choice for running Octoprint or similar software for Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D printers because it has more powerful hardware than the Raspberry Pi.</p><br>
