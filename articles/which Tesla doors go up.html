                <meta name="description" content="This blog article will provide an in-depth look at Tesla doors and how they work. Tesla doors are a unique feature of the Tesla Model S, X, and 3 vehicles. They are designed to open and close automatically with the push of a button or by using a smartphone app. We will discuss the technology behind these doors, how they work, and why they are so popular.

Tesla doors use sensors to detect when someone is near the car and then open or close accordingly.">

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tesla is a revolutionary car company that has changed the way we think about electric vehicles. The company has made a name for itself by introducing innovative features such as self-driving technology, over-the-air software updates, and of course, the iconic falcon wing doors. But what exactly are these doors and how do they work?</p>
<p>The falcon wing doors are a unique feature of Tesla's Model X SUV. They are designed to open up and outwards in an arc, allowing for easier access to the vehicle's interior. The doors are powered by two electric motors that are located in the door hinges. When activated, these motors will move the door up and outwards in an arc until it reaches its fully opened position.</p>
<p>The falcon wing doors also feature sensors that detect obstacles in their path and will automatically adjust their opening angle to avoid hitting anything. This makes them much safer than traditional car doors which can be dangerous if they hit something while opening or closing. Additionally, the falcon wing doors can be opened remotely using a key fob or smartphone app, making it even easier to get into your Tesla without having to physically open the door yourself.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Tesla Doors</h3>
<p>Tesla's falcon wing doors offer several benefits over traditional car doors. For starters, they provide easier access to the vehicle's interior due to their unique design which allows them to open up and outwards in an arc rather than just swinging outwards like traditional car doors do. This makes it much easier for passengers to get into and out of the vehicle without having to contort themselves around a traditional door frame.</p>
<p>Additionally, the falcon wing doors provide improved safety due to their obstacle detection sensors which can detect any objects in their path before they open or close. This prevents any potential injuries from occurring if someone were to accidentally walk into one of these doors while it was opening or closing.</p>
<p>Finally, Tesla's falcon wing doors offer improved convenience due to their ability to be opened remotely using either a key fob or smartphone app. This eliminates the need for passengers to physically open each door themselves when getting into or out of the vehicle which can be especially helpful when carrying multiple items at once such as groceries or luggage.</p>

<h3>Which Tesla Doors Go Up?</h3>
<p>Now that we have discussed what Tesla's falcon wing doors are and how they work, let’s answer our original question: which Tesla cars have these unique features? The answer is simple: all Model X SUVs come with falcon wing doors as standard equipment while other models such as the Model S sedan do not have this feature available as an option (although there is an aftermarket kit available).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that while all Model X SUVs come with falcon wing doors as standard equipment, not all of them will actually go up when opened due to certain factors such as height restrictions or nearby obstacles blocking their path (as mentioned earlier). In these cases, you may need to manually adjust your car’s settings so that its falcon wing door will go up when opened instead of just swinging outwards like a traditional car door would do.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, Tesla’s iconic falcon wing doors are a unique feature found on all Model X SUVs but not on other models such as the Model S sedan (although there is an aftermarket kit available). These special type of car doors offer several benefits over traditional ones including improved access due to their unique design which allows them to open up and outwards in an arc rather than just swinging outwards like regular car doors do; improved safety due to their obstacle detection sensors; and improved convenience due to their ability to be opened remotely using either a key fob or smartphone app. However, not all Model X SUVs will actually go up when opened due certain factors such as height restrictions or nearby obstacles blocking its path so you may need manually adjust your car’s settings so that its falcon wing door will go up instead of just swinging outwards like regular car door would do if this happens with your vehicle too!</p>
