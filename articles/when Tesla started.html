<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tesla is one of the most innovative and revolutionary companies in the world today. Founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, Tesla has become a leader in electric vehicle technology and renewable energy solutions. But how did it all start? In this blog post, we'll take a look at the history of Tesla and explore when it first began.</p>			
<h3>The Early Years: The Founding of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The two had previously worked together at a company called NuvoMedia, where they developed an e-book reader called the Rocket eBook. After leaving NuvoMedia, they decided to pursue their dream of creating an electric car that would be both stylish and efficient. They recruited Elon Musk to join them as chairman and CEO, and he provided much of the initial funding for the company.</p>
<p>In 2004, Tesla Motors unveiled its first prototype vehicle, the Roadster. This two-seater sports car was powered by lithium-ion batteries and could travel up to 245 miles on a single charge. It was also capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in just 4 seconds – making it one of the fastest production cars available at that time.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Tesla: Going Public & Expanding Its Reach</h3>
<p>In 2010, Tesla Motors went public on NASDAQ with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $17 per share. This marked a major milestone for the company as it allowed them to raise additional funds for research and development projects. Over time, Tesla's stock price rose significantly as investors began to recognize its potential for growth and innovation.</p>
<p>In 2012, Tesla released its second vehicle – the Model S sedan – which quickly became one of its most popular models due to its range (up to 265 miles on a single charge) and performance (0-60 mph in just 2.5 seconds). This was followed by other models such as the Model X SUV (2015) and Model 3 sedan (2017). Today, Tesla has become one of the leading automakers in terms of sales volume with over 500,000 vehicles sold worldwide since its inception in 2003.</p>

<h3>Tesla's Impact on Automotive Technology & Renewable Energy Solutions</h3>
<p>When Tesla first started out in 2003, electric vehicles were still seen as something futuristic or impractical due to their limited range and slow charging times compared to gasoline-powered cars. However, thanks to advances in battery technology over time – along with investments from companies like Tesla – electric vehicles have become increasingly popular over recent years due to their improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars.</p>
<p>In addition to revolutionizing automotive technology with its electric vehicles, Tesla has also made significant strides in renewable energy solutions such as solar power systems for homes and businesses. In 2016, they acquired SolarCity – one of America's leading solar panel installers – which allowed them to offer integrated solar power systems that are connected directly into their vehicles' batteries for charging purposes. This has enabled homeowners across America to reduce their electricity bills while also helping reduce carbon emissions from traditional fossil fuel sources such as coal or natural gas plants.</p>
<p>Overall, since its founding in 2003 by Elon Musk and his team at Tesla Motors, this innovative automaker has had a major impact on both automotive technology and renewable energy solutions around the world today – making it one of the most influential companies in modern history!</p>
