        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question is yes, you can use a Kaggle dataset with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license to create projects and publish them on GitHub. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind when doing so.</p><br><p class="article-text">First, it is important to understand the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. This license allows you to share, remix, and adapt the dataset, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original creator, do not use the dataset for commercial purposes, and share any modifications you make to the dataset under the same license.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, you should be aware that some datasets on Kaggle may have additional restrictions or requirements. For example, some datasets may require you to obtain permission from the original creator before using the dataset for any purpose. Additionally, some datasets may have restrictions on how you can use the data, such as not allowing you to use the data for commercial purposes. It is important to read the license agreement for any dataset you are considering using to ensure that you are in compliance with all of the terms.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5723268/pexels-photo-5723268.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-showing-paper-with-prohibition-sign"><figcaption>picture by Anete Lusina</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, when publishing your project on GitHub, you should include a link to the original dataset and a statement that the dataset is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. This will ensure that anyone who views your project is aware of the license and can comply with its terms.</p><br>
