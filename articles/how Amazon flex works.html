<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Amazon Flex is an on-demand delivery service that allows independent contractors to deliver packages for Amazon.com. It is a great way for people to make extra money in their spare time, as they can choose when and where they want to work. The service was launched in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular ways for people to make money on the side.</p>
<p>Amazon Flex works by allowing independent contractors to sign up and then select delivery blocks that fit their schedule. Once a block is selected, the contractor will be given a list of packages that need to be delivered within that block. The contractor will then pick up the packages from an Amazon warehouse or other designated location and deliver them to customers’ homes or businesses.</p>
<p>The amount of money earned by an Amazon Flex contractor depends on several factors, including the size of the package, the distance it needs to be delivered, and any additional fees associated with the delivery. Generally speaking, contractors can expect to earn between $18-$25 per hour depending on these factors.</p>			
<h3>How Does Amazon Flex Work?</h3>
<p>The process of becoming an Amazon Flex contractor is relatively simple. First, you must download the app from either Google Play or Apple App Store and create an account with your personal information. Once your account has been created, you will need to provide some additional information such as your driver’s license number and vehicle information if you plan on using your own car for deliveries.</p>
<p>Once all of this information has been provided, you will be able to view available delivery blocks in your area and select one that fits your schedule. You will then receive a list of packages that need to be delivered within that block along with instructions on where they need to go. After picking up the packages from an Amazon warehouse or other designated location, you will then deliver them directly to customers’ homes or businesses within the allotted time frame.</p>

<h3>What Are The Benefits Of Working With Amazon Flex?</h3>
<p>There are many benefits associated with working as an Amazon Flex contractor, including: -Flexible Schedule: As mentioned above, one of the biggest benefits of working with Amazon Flex is its flexibility; you can choose when and where you want to work based on your own schedule and availability. This makes it ideal for those who have other commitments such as school or family obligations but still want to make some extra money in their spare time. -Competitive Pay: As mentioned above, contractors can expect to earn between $18-$25 per hour depending on various factors such as package size and distance traveled during delivery. This makes it a great way for people looking for extra income without having to commit too much time or energy into it. -No Experience Necessary: Unlike many other jobs out there, no prior experience is necessary in order to become an Amazon Flex contractor; all you need is a valid driver’s license and vehicle insurance if applicable (if using your own car). This makes it ideal for those who are just starting out in their career or looking for something part-time while they gain more experience elsewhere.</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, working as an Amazon Flex contractor can be a great way for people looking for extra income without having too much commitment involved; it offers flexible hours so you can work around other commitments such as school or family obligations while still making some extra cash in your spare time!
