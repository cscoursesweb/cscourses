                        <p class="article-text">If you’ve ever experienced a bootloop caused by accidental “fix contexts” from TWRP, you know how frustrating it can be. A bootloop is when your device gets stuck in a continuous loop of rebooting, and it can be caused by a variety of issues. In this case, it’s caused by a misstep in TWRP, the popular custom recovery tool. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to fix the bootloop and get your device back up and running.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to boot into recovery mode. To do this, turn off your device and then press and hold the power button and volume down button at the same time. This will bring up the recovery menu. From here, you can select the “Wipe Data/Factory Reset” option. This will reset your device to its factory settings, which should fix the bootloop.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/959427/pexels-photo-959427.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-holding-black-remote-control"><figcaption>picture by Torsten Dettlaff</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If this doesn’t work, you can try flashing a new ROM. This is a bit more complicated, but it’s still doable. First, you’ll need to download the ROM you want to flash. Then, you’ll need to boot into recovery mode and select the “Install” option. From here, you can select the ROM you downloaded and flash it to your device. This should fix the bootloop.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if neither of these methods work, you can try a full system restore. This is a bit more complicated, but it’s still doable. First, you’ll need to download a copy of the stock firmware for your device. Then, you’ll need to boot into recovery mode and select the “Install” option. From here, you can select the stock firmware you downloaded and flash it to your device. This should fix the bootloop.</p><br>
