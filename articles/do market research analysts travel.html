<h3>Types of Market Research Analysts</h3>
<p>Market research analysts come in many different shapes and sizes. Some specialize in consumer behavior while others focus on data analysis or marketing strategy. Depending on the type of analyst you are, your job duties and responsibilities can vary greatly. Here are some of the most common types of market research analysts:</p>

This type of analyst typically does not have to travel as their work can be done remotely or in an office setting.</p>
<p>* Data Analyst: A data analyst collects and analyzes large amounts of data from various sources such as surveys, customer feedback forms, sales records, etc. They use this data to identify trends and patterns that can help inform business decisions. Data analysts may need to travel occasionally if they need to collect data from a specific location or attend conferences related to their field.</p>
