                        <p class="article-text">Posting an audio file from an Angular frontend to a Flask backend can be a tricky process, but with the right steps, it can be done quickly and easily. In this article, we’ll walk through the steps necessary to post an audio file (either a blob file or its generated URL) from an Angular frontend to a Flask backend.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you’ll need to create an Angular service that will handle the file upload. This service should include a method that takes the audio file as an argument and then posts it to the backend. The method should also return a promise that resolves with the response from the backend.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/12935044/pexels-photo-12935044.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="worker-using-a-touchscreen-monitor"><figcaption>picture by iMin Technology</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you’ll need to create a Flask route that will handle the file upload. This route should accept the audio file as an argument and then save it to the backend. The route should also return a response with the URL of the uploaded file.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you’ve created the Angular service and the Flask route, you’ll need to connect them. To do this, you’ll need to use the Angular HttpClient to make a POST request to the Flask route. The request should include the audio file as a parameter.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7953208/pexels-photo-7953208.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="road-landscape-sunset-field"><figcaption>picture by Ricardo Ortiz</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once the request is made, the Flask route will handle the file upload and return the URL of the uploaded file. This URL can then be used to access the audio file from the backend.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you’ll need to update the Angular service to handle the response from the Flask route. The service should resolve the promise with the URL of the uploaded file.</p><br>
