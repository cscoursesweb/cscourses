<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>The Early Years: From Bookstore to Online Retailer</h3>
<p>Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, who had previously worked on Wall Street. His vision was to create an online bookstore that would offer customers a wide selection of books at competitive prices. To achieve this goal, Bezos invested his own money and raised additional funds from investors.</p>
<p>In 1995, Amazon launched its first website and began selling books online. Initially, Amazon only sold books but soon expanded its product range to include music CDs, videos, electronics, toys and games. By 1998, Amazon had become one of the largest online retailers in the world with over 3 million customers.</p>

<h3>The Dot-Com Boom: Expansion and Innovation</h3>
<p>The late 1990s saw a surge in internet usage and investment known as the dot-com boom. During this period, Amazon continued to expand its product range and began offering services such as web hosting and streaming media services. It also launched its own payment system called Amazon Payments which allowed customers to pay for goods using their credit cards or bank accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to expanding its product range and services, Amazon also began investing heavily in technology innovation during this period. This included launching new products such as Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets as well as developing cloud computing services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services).</p>

<h3>Going Global: International Expansion</h3>
<p>By 2000, Amazon had become a global company with operations in multiple countries around the world including Canada, Japan, Germany and France. This international expansion allowed Amazon to reach new markets and expand its customer base even further.</p>
<p>In addition to expanding into new markets, Amazon also began offering more localized services such as language translation for international customers as well as local payment options for different countries. This allowed customers from all over the world to access Amazon's products and services more easily than ever before.</p>

It has become a household name thanks to its wide selection of products ranging from books to electronics to groceries as well as its innovative technology solutions such as AWS cloud computing services.</p>
<p>Amazon continues to invest heavily in innovation with plans for further expansion into new markets such as India and China while also exploring new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). With these investments in technology innovation combined with its global reach, there's no telling what heights Amazon will reach next!</p>
