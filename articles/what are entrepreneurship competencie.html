This requires having an open mind and being willing to try new things even if they may not work out perfectly at first. It also involves staying up-to-date on industry trends so that you can anticipate changes before they happen and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different competencies required for successful entrepreneurship including understanding your market, developing a business plan, building relationships with stakeholders, managing finances effectively, and having adaptability when necessary.
