                        <p class="article-text">If you are running a Tomcat 9 container and have noticed that the time is off by one hour, you may be wondering how to fix the wrong time in your container. This issue can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect timezone settings, incorrect system clock settings, or a misconfigured application server. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, you should check the timezone settings in your container. If the timezone is set incorrectly, it can cause the time to be off by one hour. To check the timezone settings, open the container's configuration file and look for the "timezone" setting. If the timezone is set incorrectly, you can change it to the correct value.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/48770/business-time-clock-clocks-48770.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="london-new-york-tokyo-and-moscow-clocks"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Next, you should check the system clock settings. If the system clock is set incorrectly, it can cause the time to be off by one hour. To check the system clock settings, open the container's configuration file and look for the "clock" setting. If the clock is set incorrectly, you can change it to the correct value.</p><br><p class="article-text">Finally, you should check the application server settings. If the application server is misconfigured, it can cause the time to be off by one hour. To check the application server settings, open the container's configuration file and look for the "application server" setting. If the application server is misconfigured, you can change it to the correct value.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4792285/pexels-photo-4792285.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-choosing-document-in-folder"><figcaption>picture by Anete Lusina</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have checked the timezone, system clock, and application server settings, you should restart the container to ensure that the changes take effect. After restarting the container, the time should be correct.</p><br><p class="article-text">If the time is still off by one hour after restarting the container, you may need to investigate further. You can check the system logs to see if there are any errors related to the time settings. You can also check the system clock to make sure it is set correctly.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1423241/pexels-photo-1423241.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gray-camper-trailer-on-grass-field"><figcaption>picture by Djordje Petrovic</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you may need to contact your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance. They may be able to help you troubleshoot the issue and resolve the wrong time in your container.</p><br>
