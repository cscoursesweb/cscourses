        <p class="article-text">Data science and machine learning are two of the most popular topics in the tech world today. But are they the same? The answer is no. While they are related, they are two distinct disciplines.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/247819/pexels-photo-247819.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="letter-blocks"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Data science is a broad field that encompasses the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. It involves the use of various techniques and tools to extract insights from data. Data scientists use a variety of methods to analyze data, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p><br><p class="article-text">Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are used to identify patterns in data and make predictions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/590022/pexels-photo-590022.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-survey-spreadsheet"><figcaption>picture by Lukas</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">So, while data science and machine learning are related, they are not the same. Data science is a broader field that encompasses the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.</p><br><p class="article-text">One of the key differences between data science and machine learning is the type of data they use. Data science typically uses structured data, which is data that is organized into a specific format. Machine learning, on the other hand, uses unstructured data, which is data that is not organized into a specific format.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/355948/pexels-photo-355948.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="clear-light-bulb"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Another key difference between data science and machine learning is the type of tasks they are used for. Data science is used for a variety of tasks, including predictive analytics, data visualization, and data mining. Machine learning is used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, data science and machine learning also differ in terms of the skills required to do them. Data science requires a variety of skills, including programming, statistics, and data analysis. Machine learning requires a deep understanding of algorithms and mathematics.</p><br>
