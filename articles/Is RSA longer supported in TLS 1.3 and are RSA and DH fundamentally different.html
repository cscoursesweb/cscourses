                <title>Is RSA longer supported in TLS 1.3 and are RSA and DH fundamentally different?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="RSA and DH (Diffie-Hellman) are two different types of encryption algorithms used to secure data in transit. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, while DH is a symmetric encryption algorithm. TLS 1.3, the latest version of the Transport Layer Security protocol, no longer supports RSA encryption. Instead, it uses DH for key exchange and authentication. While RSA and DH are both used to secure data in transit, they are fundamentally different in terms of how they work. RSA uses public-key cryptography, while DH uses a shared secret key. RSA is also more computationally intensive than DH, making it less suitable for use in TLS 1.3.">

        <p class="article-text">RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses two different keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. RSA is widely used in TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols, including TLS 1.2 and earlier versions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4577718/pexels-photo-4577718.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="woman-standing-near-old-stone-wall-with-carved-images"><figcaption>picture by Rachel Claire</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Diffie-Hellman (DH) is an algorithm for exchanging cryptographic keys over an insecure channel. It is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data. DH is used in TLS 1.3 and later versions, replacing RSA as the preferred algorithm for establishing secure connections.</p><br>
