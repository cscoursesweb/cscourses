                <meta name="description" content="When communicating with a customer about the bad quality of work you are delivering, it is important to remain professional and honest. Start by apologizing for the poor quality of work and explain the steps you are taking to rectify the situation. Offer a timeline for when the customer can expect the work to be completed and provide a plan of action for how you will ensure the quality of the work is improved. Be sure to listen to the customer's feedback and take it into consideration when making changes. Finally, thank the customer for bringing the issue to your attention and for their patience as you work to resolve the issue.">
