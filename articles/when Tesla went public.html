<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tesla Motors, the electric car company founded by Elon Musk, has become one of the most successful companies in the world. The company went public in 2010 and has since seen its stock price skyrocket. In this blog post, we will take a look at the history of Tesla's initial public offering (IPO) and how it has impacted the company's success.</p>			
<h3>The Early Years of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers led by Elon Musk. The company was initially funded by private investors, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The goal of the company was to develop electric cars that were both stylish and efficient.</p>
<p>In 2008, Tesla released its first car, the Roadster. The Roadster was an instant hit with consumers and helped to establish Tesla as a leader in electric vehicle technology. In 2009, Tesla received a $465 million loan from the US Department of Energy to help fund its operations.</p>

<h3>Tesla's Initial Public Offering (IPO)</h3>
<p>In June 2010, Tesla announced that it would be going public through an initial public offering (IPO). On June 29th, 2010, Tesla sold 13.3 million shares at $17 per share for a total of $226 million in proceeds. This marked the first time that an American car manufacturer had gone public since Ford Motor Company did so in 1956.</p>
<p>The IPO was met with enthusiasm from investors who saw potential in Tesla's innovative technology and business model. After going public, Tesla's stock price rose steadily over the next few years as more people became aware of the company's products and services. By 2013, Tesla had become one of the most valuable companies on Wall Street with a market capitalization of over $20 billion dollars.</p>			
<h3>The Impact Of Going Public On Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>Going public had a major impact on Tesla Motors' success as a company. Firstly, it allowed them to raise much needed capital which they used to expand their operations and develop new products such as their Model S sedan and Model X SUV vehicles. Secondly, it gave them access to larger markets which allowed them to reach more customers around the world with their products and services. Finally, going public also gave them access to more resources such as talent which enabled them to continue innovating and developing new technologies for their vehicles such as Autopilot and Supercharging stations for faster charging times for their cars' batteries.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Tesla's decision to go public back in 2010 has been instrumental in helping them become one of the most successful companies in the world today. By raising capital through their IPO they were able to expand their operations and develop new products which have helped make electric vehicles more accessible than ever before. Going public also gave them access to larger markets which allowed them to reach more customers around the world with their products and services while also giving them access to more resources such as talent which enabled them to continue innovating and developing new technologies for their vehicles such as Autopilot and Supercharging stations for faster charging times for their cars' batteries . All these factors combined have helped make electric vehicles mainstream today thanks largely due to Elon Musk’s vision when he founded Tesla Motors back in 2003</p>
