This article will provide an overview of the steps involved in creating a character creator in either Godot or Unity. 

First, you will need to decide on the type of character creator you want to create. Do you want to create a character creator for a game, or a character creator for a 3D animation? Once you have decided on the type of character creator you want to create, you will need to decide on the type of assets you will need. This includes 3D models, textures, and animations. 

Next, you will need to create the character creator interface. This includes creating the menus, buttons, and other elements that will allow users to customize their characters. You will also need to create the logic behind the character creator, such as how the user can select different options and how the character will">

In this article, we’ll go over the process of creating a character creator like Black Desert in Godot or Unity.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in creating a character creator like Black Desert in Godot or Unity is to create the character model. This can be done by either creating the model from scratch or using a pre-made model. If you’re creating the model from scratch, you’ll need to use a 3D modeling program such as Blender or Maya. If you’re using a pre-made model, you’ll need to import it into the game engine.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once the character model is created, you’ll need to create the character customization system. This system will allow players to customize their character’s appearance, such as hair color, skin color, and clothing. This can be done by creating a UI system that allows players to select different options.</p><br><p class="article-text">The next step is to create the character animation system. This system will allow players to animate their character’s movements, such as walking, running, and jumping. This can be done by using a 3D animation program such as Maya or Blender.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1840756/pexels-photo-1840756.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="pink-paper-origami"><figcaption>picture by Miguel Á. Padriñán</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">The final step is to create the character AI system. This system will allow the character to interact with the environment and other characters in the game. This can be done by using a game engine such as Godot or Unity.</p><br>
