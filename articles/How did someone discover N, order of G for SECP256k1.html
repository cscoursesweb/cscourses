                <title>How did someone discover N, order of G for SECP256k1?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="The discovery of the N, order of G for SECP256k1 was a major breakthrough in cryptography. In 2008, a team of researchers led by Dr. Daniel J. Bernstein published a paper detailing their findings. The paper outlined the mathematical properties of the elliptic curve used in the SECP256k1 algorithm, and how it could be used to generate a secure public-key cryptography system. The paper also described the process of generating the N, order of G for SECP256k1, which is a key component of the algorithm. The discovery of the N, order of G for SECP256k1 has been instrumental in the development of secure communication systems, and has been widely adopted by many organizations.">
