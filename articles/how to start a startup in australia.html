<h3> Research Your Idea</h3>
<p>The first step to starting a startup is to research your idea. You need to make sure that your idea is viable and that there is a market for it.

<h3> Develop Your Business Plan</h3>
<p>Once you have researched your idea and determined that it has potential, it’s time to develop a business plan. A business plan outlines the goals of your startup, how you plan to achieve them, and how much money you need to get started.

<h3> Register Your Business</h3>
<p>Once you have developed your business plan, it’s time to register your business with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC). This process involves completing an application form and paying any applicable fees. Once registered with ASIC, you will receive an Australian Business Number (ABN) which is required for tax purposes and other legal requirements such as opening a bank account or applying for loans or grants.</p>

When hiring employees make sure that they are qualified for the job by conducting interviews and background checks if necessary. Additionally make sure that they understand their job responsibilities as well as any applicable laws or regulations related to their position such as workplace safety regulations or anti-discrimination laws etc..</p>
