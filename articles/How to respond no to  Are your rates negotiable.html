                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to running a business, one of the most common questions you’ll hear from potential customers is “Are your rates negotiable?” It’s a tricky question to answer, as you don’t want to appear inflexible, but you also don’t want to give away too much of your hard-earned profits.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The best way to respond to this question is to be honest and direct. Let the customer know that you are open to discussing the rate, but that you have a set rate that you are comfortable with. This will show the customer that you are willing to negotiate, but that you also value your services and won’t be taken advantage of.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7887054/pexels-photo-7887054.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-blooming-purple-flower"><figcaption>picture by Mercy Isaac</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">If the customer is still interested in negotiating, you can offer to discuss the rate further. You can explain that you are willing to work with them to find a rate that works for both of you. You can also offer to provide additional services or discounts to make the rate more attractive.</p><br><p class="article-text">It’s important to remember that you don’t have to accept any offer that is presented to you. If the customer’s offer is too low, you can politely decline and explain that you are not able to accept the offer. You can also explain that you are open to discussing the rate further if they are willing to make a more reasonable offer.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/601170/pexels-photo-601170.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="two-women-holding-pen"><figcaption>picture by Tirachard Kumtanom</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">No matter how you respond to the question, it’s important to remain professional and courteous. You want to make sure that the customer knows that you value their business and that you are willing to work with them to find a rate that works for both of you.</p><br>
