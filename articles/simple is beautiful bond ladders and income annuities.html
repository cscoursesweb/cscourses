<h3>What is a Bond Ladder?</h3>
<p>A bond ladder is an investment strategy that involves buying bonds with different maturities in order to create a steady stream of income. The idea behind this strategy is that as each bond matures, the investor will reinvest the proceeds into another bond with a longer maturity date. This allows the investor to maintain a steady stream of income while also taking advantage of changing interest rates over time.</p>
<p>The key to making this strategy work is to buy bonds with different maturities so that when one matures, there are still other bonds in the portfolio that will continue to generate income until they mature as well. This allows investors to maintain their desired level of income while also taking advantage of changing interest rates over time.</p>

<h3>What is an Income Annuity?</h3>
<p>An income annuity is an insurance product that provides investors with a guaranteed stream of income for life or for a set period of time. This type of product can be purchased from an insurance company or from an investment firm such as Vanguard or Fidelity. The key benefit of an income annuity is that it provides investors with guaranteed payments regardless of market conditions or other factors such as inflation or deflation.</p>
<p>Income annuities can be structured in many different ways depending on the needs and goals of the investor. For example, some annuities may provide payments for life while others may provide payments for only a certain number of years or until certain conditions are met (such as reaching retirement age). Additionally, some annuities may provide payments based on market performance while others may provide fixed payments regardless of market performance.</p>
