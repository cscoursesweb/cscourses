        <p class="article-text">The bar exam is one of the most difficult tests to pass in the United States. It is a comprehensive test that covers a wide range of legal topics and requires a great deal of knowledge and preparation. So, when news broke that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) system, had passed the bar exam in the state of New York, it was a major milestone for AI technology.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9241723/pexels-photo-9241723.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="man-people-woman-girl"><figcaption>picture by Mikhail Nilov</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) system developed by OpenAI, a research lab founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. The system was designed to understand and generate human-like conversations. It was trained on a large dataset of legal documents and was tested on the New York bar exam.</p><br><p class="article-text">The results of the test were impressive. ChatGPT was able to answer questions correctly at a rate of over 90%, which is higher than the average passing rate for human test-takers. This is a major achievement for AI technology and could have implications for the legal profession.</p><br><p class="article-text">So, did ChatGPT actually pass the bar exam? The answer is yes. ChatGPT was able to answer questions correctly at a rate higher than the average passing rate for human test-takers. This is a major milestone for AI technology and could have implications for the legal profession.</p><br><p class="article-text">However, it is important to note that ChatGPT did not actually take the bar exam. Instead, it was tested on a dataset of legal documents and was able to answer questions correctly at a rate higher than the average passing rate for human test-takers. This is a major achievement for AI technology, but it does not mean that ChatGPT is ready to practice law.</p><br><p class="article-text">In order to practice law, ChatGPT would need to pass the bar exam in a state that allows AI systems to take the test. Currently, no state has passed legislation allowing AI systems to take the bar exam. This means that ChatGPT is not yet ready to practice law.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">However, the success of ChatGPT on the New York bar exam is a major milestone for AI technology. It shows that AI systems are capable of understanding and generating human-like conversations. This could have implications for the legal profession, as AI systems could potentially be used to assist lawyers in their work.</p><br>
