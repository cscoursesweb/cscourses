<h3>What is Day Trading?</h3>
<p>Day trading is a form of investing that involves buying and selling stocks within the same day. This means that you buy stocks in the morning and then sell them later in the day before the markets close. The goal of day trading is to make profits from short-term price movements in stocks. It can be a risky form of investing, but if done correctly it can be very profitable.</p>

<h3>Tips for Successful Day Trading on Robinhood</h3>
<p>Day trading on Robinhood requires discipline and patience if you want to be successful. Here are some tips that will help you become a successful day trader: 1) Set realistic goals: Before you start trading, set realistic goals for yourself so that you know what kind of returns you're aiming for each month or year. This will help keep you focused on achieving those goals instead of getting distracted by short-term gains or losses. 2) Research thoroughly: Before making any trades, do your research thoroughly so that you know what kind of risks are involved with each stock before investing in it. Use tools like Robinhood's stock screener and charting tools to help narrow down your choices and make informed decisions about which stocks are worth investing in. 3) Manage risk: Risk management is key when it comes to day trading on Robinhood as there are always risks involved when investing in stocks. Make sure that you're not taking too much risk by diversifying your portfolio across different sectors and industries so that if one sector takes a hit, your other investments will still be safe from losses due to diversification benefits. Also, set stop loss orders so that if a stock drops below a certain price point, it will automatically be sold off before any further losses occur due to market volatility or other factors beyond your control. 4) Monitor markets: Markets move quickly so it's important that you stay up-to-date with news related to the companies whose stocks you're invested in as well as general market news such as economic indicators or political events which could affect stock prices significantly over short periods of time. Monitoring markets regularly will help ensure that you don't miss out on any potential opportunities due to lack of information or knowledge about current events affecting markets around the world.</p>
