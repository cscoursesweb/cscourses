                        <p class="article-text">Finally, if you’re still having trouble with your Macbook Pro decreasing screen brightness when the MagSafe charger is removed, you may need to reset your Macbook Pro’s SMC (System Management Controller). To do this, shut down your Macbook Pro and disconnect the MagSafe charger. Then, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds. This will reset the SMC and should stop your Macbook Pro from decreasing screen brightness when the MagSafe charger is removed.</p><br>
