                        <p class="article-text">If you are a web developer, you know that running the yarn build command can be a bit of a hassle. Not only does it take a long time to complete, but it also displays a lot of warnings that can be difficult to decipher. Fortunately, there are a few ways to run the yarn build command without displaying warnings.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first way to run the yarn build command without displaying warnings is to use the --silent flag. This flag will suppress all warnings and only display errors. To use this flag, simply add it to the end of your yarn build command. For example, if you were running the command “yarn build”, you would add the flag like this: “yarn build --silent”.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5660058/pexels-photo-5660058.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blurred-photo-of-a-yarn"><figcaption>picture by Eva Bronzini</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The second way to run the yarn build command without displaying warnings is to use the --no-warnings flag. This flag will suppress all warnings, but will still display errors. To use this flag, simply add it to the end of your yarn build command. For example, if you were running the command “yarn build”, you would add the flag like this: “yarn build --no-warnings”.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third way to run the yarn build command without displaying warnings is to use the --no-progress flag. This flag will suppress all warnings and errors, and will only display progress information. To use this flag, simply add it to the end of your yarn build command. For example, if you were running the command “yarn build”, you would add the flag like this: “yarn build --no-progress”.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the fourth way to run the yarn build command without displaying warnings is to use the --no-output flag. This flag will suppress all warnings, errors, and progress information, and will only display the final output. To use this flag, simply add it to the end of your yarn build command. For example, if you were running the command “yarn build”, you would add the flag like this: “yarn build --no-output”.</p><br>
