                        <p class="article-text">ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that enables machines to understand and respond to human conversations. It is a powerful tool that can be used to automate customer service, create virtual assistants, and even generate content. But despite its impressive capabilities, there are still some things that ChatGPT can’t do.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">First, ChatGPT is not capable of understanding context. It can understand the words that are used in a conversation, but it cannot understand the meaning behind them. For example, if a customer says “I need help”, ChatGPT will not be able to determine what kind of help the customer needs. This means that it cannot provide the customer with the right solution.</p><br><p class="article-text">Second, ChatGPT cannot generate original content. It can generate responses to questions, but it cannot create original content from scratch. This means that it cannot be used to create blog posts, articles, or other types of content.</p><br><p class="article-text">Third, ChatGPT cannot understand emotions. It can understand the words that are used in a conversation, but it cannot understand the emotions behind them. This means that it cannot provide the customer with the right response based on their emotional state.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/230554/pexels-photo-230554.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="person-sitting-inside-car-with-black-android-smartphone-turned-on"><figcaption>picture by Roman Pohorecki</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, ChatGPT cannot think for itself. It can generate responses to questions, but it cannot come up with its own ideas or solutions. This means that it cannot be used to solve complex problems or come up with creative solutions.</p><br>
