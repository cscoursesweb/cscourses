<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or algo-trading, is a type of trading that uses computer algorithms to automatically generate trading signals and execute trades. Algorithmic trading is used by many professional traders and financial institutions to make decisions about when to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and other financial instruments.</p>
<p>Algorithmic trading has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to quickly analyze large amounts of data and make decisions based on complex mathematical models. This type of trading can be used for both long-term investments as well as short-term trades. It can also be used for high-frequency trading (HFT), which involves making multiple trades in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>The use of algorithmic trading has grown significantly over the past decade due to advances in technology and the availability of powerful computers that can process large amounts of data quickly. As a result, algorithmic trading has become an important tool for many professional traders and investors who are looking to maximize their profits while minimizing their risk.</p>
