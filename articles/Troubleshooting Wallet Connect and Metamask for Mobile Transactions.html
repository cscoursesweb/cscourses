        <p class="article-text">Mobile transactions are becoming increasingly popular as more and more people are using their phones to make payments. However, there are some issues that can arise when using mobile wallets, such as Wallet Connect with Metamask. In this article, we will discuss some of the common issues that can arise when using Wallet Connect with Metamask in mobile transactions and how to resolve them.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5935739/pexels-photo-5935739.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="online-shopping"><figcaption>picture by Sora Shimazaki</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first issue that can arise when using Wallet Connect with Metamask in mobile transactions is that the user may not be able to connect their wallet to the Metamask app. This is because the Metamask app requires the user to have a valid Ethereum address in order to connect. If the user does not have a valid Ethereum address, they will not be able to connect their wallet to the Metamask app.</p><br><p class="article-text">The second issue that can arise when using Wallet Connect with Metamask in mobile transactions is that the user may not be able to send or receive funds. This is because the Metamask app requires the user to have a valid Ethereum address in order to send or receive funds. If the user does not have a valid Ethereum address, they will not be able to send or receive funds.</p><br><p class="article-text">The third issue that can arise when using Wallet Connect with Metamask in mobile transactions is that the user may not be able to access their wallet. This is because the Metamask app requires the user to have a valid Ethereum address in order to access their wallet. If the user does not have a valid Ethereum address, they will not be able to access their wallet.</p><br><p class="article-text">The fourth issue that can arise when using Wallet Connect with Metamask in mobile transactions is that the user may not be able to view their transaction history. This is because the Metamask app requires the user to have a valid Ethereum address in order to view their transaction history. If the user does not have a valid Ethereum address, they will not be able to view their transaction history.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1036637/pexels-photo-1036637.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="round-gold-colored-ethereum-coin"><figcaption>picture by Moose Photos</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In order to resolve these issues, the user should first make sure that they have a valid Ethereum address. Once they have a valid Ethereum address, they should then connect their wallet to the Metamask app. Once their wallet is connected to the Metamask app, they should then be able to send and receive funds, access their wallet, and view their transaction history.</p><br>
