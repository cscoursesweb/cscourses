                        <p class="article-text">Multi-step forms are a great way to collect information from users in an efficient and organized manner. They can be used as classic multiple choice forms or as a chatbot. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to consider which one is best for your particular needs.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Classic multiple choice forms are a great way to quickly collect information from users. They are easy to set up and can be used to ask a variety of questions. The downside is that they can be tedious for users to fill out, as they require users to select from a list of options. Additionally, they can be difficult to customize and may not be able to capture the full range of user responses.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3585095/pexels-photo-3585095.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="selective-focus-photography-of-man-using-smartphone-beside-string-lights"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Chatbots are a great alternative to classic multiple choice forms. They allow users to interact with the form in a more natural way, as they can type in their responses. This makes it easier for users to provide detailed answers and can help to capture more accurate information. Additionally, chatbots can be customized to ask specific questions and can be programmed to provide helpful responses. The downside is that they can be more difficult to set up and may require more time and resources to maintain.</p><br>
