<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to buy a home, you’ve probably heard of Zillow. It’s one of the most popular real estate websites out there, and it’s become a go-to resource for many homebuyers. But where exactly is Zillow selling their homes?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on what type of home you’re looking for. Zillow offers both new and existing homes for sale, so the answer will vary depending on which type of home you’re interested in. Let’s take a look at each option in more detail.</p>

<h3>New Homes</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a brand-new home, then Zillow is not the place to look. The website does not list any new construction homes for sale. Instead, they focus on existing homes that are already built and ready to move into.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in buying a new construction home, there are still plenty of options available to you. You can search for new construction homes on other real estate websites such as Realtor.com or Trulia, or you can contact local builders directly to inquire about their current listings.</p>			
<h3>Existing Homes</h3>
<p>When it comes to existing homes, Zillow is one of the best resources available. The website lists millions of homes for sale across the United States and Canada, so chances are good that they have something that fits your needs and budget.</p>
<p>In addition to listing existing homes for sale, Zillow also provides helpful information about each property such as estimated market value, recent sales history, nearby schools and amenities, and more. This makes it easy to compare different properties side-by-side and make an informed decision about which one is right for you.</p>

<h3>Rentals</h3>
<p>In addition to selling existing homes, Zillow also lists rental properties across the United States and Canada as well. This includes apartments, condos, townhomes, single-family houses, duplexes and more – all available for rent at competitive prices.</p>
<p>Zillow makes it easy to find rental properties in your area by providing detailed search filters such as price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms/square footage/etc., pet policies (if applicable), amenities offered (such as swimming pools or fitness centers), and more. This makes it easy to narrow down your search results quickly so that you can find exactly what you’re looking for without wasting time sifting through irrelevant listings.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, if you’re looking for a new or existing home then Zillow is definitely worth checking out – they have millions of listings across the United States and Canada that are sure to fit your needs and budget! However if you’re looking specifically for new construction homes then other real estate websites may be better suited towards your needs since Zillow does not list any new construction properties at this time. Finally if you need help finding a rental property then Zillow has plenty of options available as well – just use their detailed search filters to narrow down your results quickly!</p>
