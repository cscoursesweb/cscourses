                        <p class="article-text">The question of where Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like Askan.ai get their information from is an important one. AI systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are being used in a variety of applications, from customer service to medical diagnosis. As such, it is important to understand where these systems are getting their information from in order to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">In general, AI systems get their information from a variety of sources. The most common source is data. Data can come from a variety of sources, including databases, text documents, images, audio, and video. AI systems use this data to learn and make decisions. For example, an AI system might use data from customer service logs to learn how to respond to customer inquiries.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/373543/pexels-photo-373543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blue-bright-lights"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In addition to data, AI systems can also use algorithms to make decisions. Algorithms are sets of instructions that tell the AI system how to process data and make decisions. For example, an AI system might use an algorithm to determine which customer service inquiries should be answered first.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, AI systems can also use knowledge bases to make decisions. A knowledge base is a collection of facts and information that the AI system can use to make decisions. For example, an AI system might use a knowledge base of medical information to diagnose a patient.</p><br>
