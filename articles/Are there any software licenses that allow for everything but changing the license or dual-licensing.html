                <meta name="description" content="This article will discuss software licenses that allow for a wide range of uses, but restrict the ability to change the license or dual-license the software. We will look at the different types of licenses available, the restrictions they impose, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We will also discuss the implications of changing or dual-licensing a software license, and the potential legal issues that could arise. Finally, we will provide some tips for choosing the right license for your software.">

        <p class="article-text">The answer to this question is yes, there are software licenses that allow for everything but changing the license or dual-licensing. These licenses are known as “copyleft” licenses, and they are designed to ensure that the software remains free and open source.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1089438/pexels-photo-1089438.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-photo-of-matrix-background"><figcaption>picture by Markus Spiske</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Copyleft licenses are designed to ensure that the software remains free and open source by preventing anyone from changing the license or dual-licensing the software. This means that the software must remain under the same license, and no one can add additional restrictions or terms to the license.</p><br><p class="article-text">The most popular copyleft license is the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a widely used license that is designed to ensure that the software remains free and open source. It prevents anyone from changing the license or dual-licensing the software, and it also requires that any modifications or additions to the software must also be released under the same license.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14844789/pexels-photo-14844789.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="photo-of-a-young-woman-leaning-on-the-sink-in-the-public-restroom"><figcaption>picture by Elena Rubtsova</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The GPL is not the only copyleft license available. There are a number of other licenses that are designed to ensure that the software remains free and open source. These include the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the Mozilla Public License (MPL), and the Apache License.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Each of these licenses has its own set of rules and restrictions, so it is important to read and understand the license before using it. It is also important to note that some of these licenses may not be compatible with other licenses, so it is important to check for compatibility before using them.</p><br>
