        <p class="article-text">If you’re using Flutter to build a mobile app, you may have encountered an issue where the feed with Future Builder is not updating on the first build of the screen, only after scrolling. This can be a frustrating issue, as it can be difficult to determine the cause. In this article, we’ll discuss the possible causes of this issue and how to fix it.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5090853/pexels-photo-5090853.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="brown-humming-bird-flying"><figcaption>picture by Jill Wellington</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The most common cause of this issue is that the Future Builder is not being called on the first build of the screen. This can happen if the Future Builder is not being called in the initState() method of the widget. The initState() method is called when the widget is first created, and it is where the Future Builder should be called. If the Future Builder is not called in the initState() method, then it will not be called on the first build of the screen.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another possible cause of this issue is that the Future Builder is not being called with the correct parameters. The Future Builder needs to be called with the correct parameters in order for it to update the feed on the first build of the screen. If the parameters are incorrect, then the Future Builder will not be called and the feed will not be updated.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, the issue could be caused by a bug in the Flutter framework. If the issue persists after trying the above solutions, then it is likely a bug in the Flutter framework. In this case, it is best to report the issue to the Flutter team so that they can investigate and fix the issue.</p><br>
