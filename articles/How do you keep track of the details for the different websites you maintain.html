                        <p class="article-text">Maintaining multiple websites can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to keeping track of all the details. From content updates to technical maintenance, there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of. Fortunately, there are a few strategies you can use to make sure you stay on top of all the details for the different websites you maintain.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to create a detailed plan for each website. This plan should include a list of all the tasks that need to be completed, as well as a timeline for when they should be completed. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don’t miss any important details.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6393013/pexels-photo-6393013.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="freelancer-browsing-laptop-and-taking-notes-in-notebook-during-work"><figcaption>picture by William  Fortunato</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The next step is to create a system for tracking the progress of each website. This could be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as a project management system. The important thing is that you have a way to easily see what tasks have been completed and what tasks still need to be done.</p><br><p class="article-text">Once you have a system in place, it’s important to stay on top of it. Set aside time each week to review the progress of each website and make sure that all tasks are being completed on time. This will help you stay on top of any potential issues before they become major problems.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1047524/pexels-photo-1047524.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="pen-on-yellow-and-red-board"><figcaption>picture by Steve Johnson</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s important to stay organized. Create folders for each website and store all relevant documents in them. This will make it easier to find the information you need when you need it.</p><br>
