                        <p class="article-text">Maintaining multiple websites can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to keeping track of all the details. From content updates to technical maintenance, there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of. Fortunately, there are a few strategies you can use to make sure you stay on top of all the details for the different websites you maintain.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step is to create a detailed plan for each website. This plan should include a list of all the tasks that need to be completed, as well as a timeline for when they should be completed. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don’t miss any important details.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/733857/pexels-photo-733857.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="white-blank-notebook"><figcaption>picture by Tirachard Kumtanom</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Once you have a plan in place, it’s important to create a system for tracking the progress of each task. This could be as simple as a spreadsheet or a more complex project management system. Whatever system you choose, make sure it’s easy to use and allows you to quickly see the status of each task.</p><br><p class="article-text">It’s also important to set up a system for tracking changes to the websites. This could be as simple as a log of all the changes that have been made, or a more complex version control system. This will help you keep track of any changes that have been made, as well as any potential issues that may arise.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4734933/pexels-photo-4734933.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="blackboard-with-your-life-matters-inscription-on-black-background"><figcaption>picture by Brett Sayles</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, it’s important to stay on top of any technical maintenance that needs to be done. This could include updating plugins, making sure the website is secure, and ensuring that the website is running smoothly. Setting up a system for tracking these tasks will help you stay on top of any potential issues and ensure that your websites are running optimally.</p><br>
