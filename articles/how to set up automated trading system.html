<h3>What is an Automated Trading System?</h3>
<p>An automated trading system (ATS) is a computer program that uses algorithms and data analysis to make decisions about when and how to buy or sell stocks, commodities, or other financial instruments. The ATS is programmed with specific rules and parameters that determine when it should enter or exit a trade. It then executes these trades automatically without any human intervention.</p>			
<h3>Benefits of Automated Trading Systems</h3>
<p>Automated trading systems offer several advantages over manual trading. First, they are able to execute trades much faster than humans can. This means that they are able to take advantage of short-term market movements that may not be visible to the human eye. Additionally, since the ATS does not get tired or emotional like humans do, it is able to make more consistent decisions over time. Finally, since the ATS does not require any human intervention once it has been programmed with its rules and parameters, traders are free from having to constantly monitor their positions in order to make sure they are making profitable trades.</p>			
<h3>Steps for Setting Up an Automated Trading System</h3>
<p>Setting up an automated trading system requires several steps: 1) Choose a Broker: The first step in setting up an automated trading system is choosing a broker who offers access to the markets you want to trade in as well as the ability to use automated trading systems on their platform. Make sure you research different brokers before making your decision so that you can find one who meets your needs and offers competitive fees and commissions. 2) Choose Your Platform: Once you have chosen your broker, you will need to choose which platform you want your ATS to run on. Most brokers offer several different platforms such as MetaTrader 4 (MT4), NinjaTrader 8 (NT8), TradeStation 9 (TS9), etc., so make sure you research each one before deciding which one is best for your needs. 3) Program Your Rules: Once you have chosen your platform, you will need to program your ATS with its rules and parameters such as when it should enter or exit a trade as well as what type of orders it should use (market orders vs limit orders). This step requires some knowledge of programming languages such as MQL4/5 or C#/C++ so if you don’t have any experience with these languages then it may be best for you hire someone who does in order help program your ATS correctly. 4) Backtest Your System: Once your ATS has been programmed with its rules and parameters, it’s important that you backtest it on historical data before putting real money into it in order ensure that it works properly and makes profitable trades over time. Most platforms offer backtesting capabilities so make sure you take advantage of them before going live with your system. 5) Go Live: Once you have tested your system on historical data and are satisfied with its performance then it’s time for you go live with real money! Make sure that when going live with real money that start small until you become comfortable with how the system works before increasing the size of your positions over time if desired.</p>
