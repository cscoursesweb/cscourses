<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tesla is one of the most innovative and revolutionary companies in the world today. Founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, Tesla has become a leader in electric vehicle technology and renewable energy solutions. But when was Tesla founded? Let's take a look at the history of this amazing company.</p>
<p>Tesla was founded on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The two had previously worked together at a company called NuvoMedia, where they developed an e-book reader called the Rocket eBook. After leaving NuvoMedia, they decided to start their own company and focus on electric vehicles. They named their new venture Tesla Motors after Nikola Tesla, the famous inventor and scientist who pioneered alternating current (AC) electricity supply systems.</p>
<p>At first, Tesla focused on developing electric sports cars that could compete with gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of performance and speed. In 2006, they released their first car: the Roadster. This two-seater electric sports car had a range of 245 miles per charge and could go from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds. It was an instant hit with consumers and helped put Tesla on the map as a major player in the automotive industry.</p>

<h3> The Early Years of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>In 2008, Elon Musk joined Tesla as its Chairman of the Board of Directors and became its largest investor at that time. He quickly set about transforming the company into something much bigger than just an electric car manufacturer – he wanted to make it into a leader in sustainable energy solutions for both consumers and businesses alike.</p>
<p>In 2009, Tesla released its second car: the Model S sedan. This all-electric luxury sedan had a range of up to 300 miles per charge and could go from 0 to 60 mph in just 4 seconds – making it one of the fastest production cars ever made at that time. It was also one of the first cars to feature an autopilot system that allowed it to drive itself on highways without any input from its driver – something that would become commonplace years later with other automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and Audi introducing similar systems into their vehicles as well.</p>
<p>In 2010, Tesla opened its first retail store in Los Angeles – marking another milestone for the company as it began to expand beyond just selling cars online or through dealerships like other automakers did at that time. This move helped make buying an electric car more accessible for consumers who may not have been able to purchase one otherwise due to limited availability or lack of knowledge about them at that time period.</p>			
<h3> The Expansion Of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>In 2012, Tesla released its third car: the Model X SUV – which featured falcon wing doors that opened upwards instead of outwards like traditional doors do – making it one of the most unique vehicles ever made at that time period as well as being incredibly practical for families who needed more space than what a sedan could offer them but still wanted an all-electric vehicle with great range capabilities (up to 295 miles per charge).</p>
<p>In 2015, Tesla released its fourth car: the Model 3 sedan – which was designed to be more affordable than previous models while still offering great performance (0-60 mph in 5 seconds) and range (up to 310 miles per charge). This model quickly became popular among consumers due to its lower price point compared to other luxury sedans on the market at that time period as well as being one of only a few all-electric vehicles available for purchase then too.</p>

<h3> The Future Of Tesla Motors</h3>
<p>Today, Tesla is continuing its mission towards sustainable energy solutions by expanding beyond just producing cars into other areas such as solar panels for homes/businesses (SolarCity), battery storage solutions (Powerwall), autonomous driving technology (Autopilot), ride sharing services (Tesla Network), etc… All these initiatives are helping make renewable energy sources more accessible for everyone while also helping reduce our dependence on fossil fuels which are damaging our environment every day we continue using them without any alternatives available yet until now thanks to companies like Tesla leading this revolution forward!</p>
