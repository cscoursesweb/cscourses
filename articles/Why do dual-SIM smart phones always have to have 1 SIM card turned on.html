                <meta name="description" content="A dual-SIM smartphone is a device that allows users to have two active SIM cards in one device. This is a great feature for those who need to use two different phone numbers, such as for business and personal use. However, many people wonder why dual-SIM phones always require one SIM card to be turned on. The answer lies in the way the phone is designed. 

When a dual-SIM phone is designed, the two SIM cards are connected to the same antenna. This means that the phone can only receive signals from one SIM card at a time. Therefore, in order for the phone to be able to receive signals from both SIM cards, one of them must be turned on. This ensures that the phone can receive signals from both SIM cards, allowing users to switch between them as needed. 

In addition, having one SIM card turned on also helps to conserve battery life. When both SIM cards are turned on, the phone has to constantly search for">

                        <p class="article-text">Dual-SIM smart phones are becoming increasingly popular, as they allow users to have two phone numbers on one device. However, many people are confused as to why dual-SIM phones always have to have one SIM card turned on.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The reason for this is that dual-SIM phones are designed to use two different networks simultaneously. This means that one SIM card is used for making calls and sending texts, while the other is used for data services such as browsing the internet or using apps.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6863332/pexels-photo-6863332.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="tax-documents-on-the-table"><figcaption>picture by Nataliya Vaitkevich</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">In order for the phone to be able to use both networks, it needs to have one SIM card turned on at all times. This is because the phone needs to be able to switch between the two networks in order to provide the best coverage and connection.</p><br><p class="article-text">If both SIM cards were turned off, the phone would not be able to switch between networks and would be unable to make calls or access the internet. This would mean that the phone would be unable to perform any of its basic functions.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6963311/pexels-photo-6963311.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-woman-and-man-gambling-together"><figcaption>picture by cottonbro studio</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">It is also important to note that dual-SIM phones are designed to be used with two different networks. This means that if both SIM cards are from the same network, the phone will not be able to switch between them and will only be able to use one network at a time.</p><br>
