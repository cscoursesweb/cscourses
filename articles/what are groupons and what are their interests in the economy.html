<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Groupons are a type of coupon that offer discounts on products or services. They are typically distributed through online platforms, such as websites or mobile apps. Groupons are usually offered by businesses to attract new customers and increase sales. The idea behind Groupons is that they provide an incentive for customers to purchase goods or services at a discounted rate, which can help businesses increase their profits.</p>
<p>Groupons have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they offer a great way for businesses to reach out to potential customers and increase their sales. In addition, Groupons can be used to promote special offers or discounts on products or services that may not otherwise be available. This can help businesses attract more customers and boost their profits.</p>
<p>Groupons also have an impact on the economy as a whole. By offering discounts on goods and services, Groupons can help stimulate consumer spending, which in turn helps to boost economic growth. Additionally, Groupons can help businesses reduce their costs by providing them with an alternative way of advertising their products or services without having to pay for expensive traditional advertising campaigns. This can help businesses save money and reinvest it into other areas of their business, such as research and development or hiring new employees.</p>			
<h3>How Do Groupons Work?</h3>
<p>Groupon works by offering discounts on products or services from participating businesses in exchange for customers signing up for the service. Customers then receive notifications when new deals become available in their area, allowing them to take advantage of the discounts offered by the business.</p>
<p>When a customer purchases a deal through Groupon, the business pays a commission fee to the platform for each sale made through its platform. This commission fee is typically between 10-50% of the total cost of the deal purchased by the customer. The commission fees collected by Groupon are then used to cover its operating costs and generate profits for its shareholders.</p>
