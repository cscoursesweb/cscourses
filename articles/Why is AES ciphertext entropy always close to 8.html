                <title>Why is AES ciphertext entropy always close to 8?</title>
                <meta name="description" content="AES ciphertext entropy is always close to 8 because the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. This means that the output of the encryption process is always 128 bits, regardless of the size of the input. Since the output is always 128 bits, the entropy of the ciphertext is always close to 8. This makes AES a very secure encryption algorithm, as it is difficult to guess the key from the ciphertext.">

                        <p class="article-text">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that is used to protect sensitive data. It is a block cipher, meaning it takes a fixed-length block of plaintext as input and produces a fixed-length block of ciphertext as output. AES is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available today.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">One of the key features of AES is its high level of entropy. Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a ciphertext, and it is important for ensuring that the ciphertext is difficult to crack. AES has a particularly high level of entropy, and it is always close to 8.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1842/nature-photography-analog-camera-canon.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="nature-photography-analog-camera-canon"><figcaption>picture by Little Visuals</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The reason why AES ciphertext entropy is always close to 8 is because of the way the algorithm works. AES is a block cipher, meaning it takes a fixed-length block of plaintext as input and produces a fixed-length block of ciphertext as output. This means that the ciphertext is always the same length as the plaintext, and the entropy of the ciphertext is determined by the length of the plaintext.</p><br><p class="article-text">AES uses a 128-bit block size, meaning that the plaintext is always 128 bits in length. This means that the entropy of the ciphertext is always close to 8, since 128 bits is equal to 8 bytes. This is because each byte of the ciphertext is determined by 8 bits of the plaintext.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6999117/pexels-photo-6999117.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="battle-rope-and-slam-ball-on-floor-in-gym"><figcaption>picture by Monstera</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">In addition to the block size, AES also uses a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. This means that the entropy of the ciphertext is also determined by the key size. The larger the key size, the higher the entropy of the ciphertext.</p><br>
