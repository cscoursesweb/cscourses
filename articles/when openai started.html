<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company that was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba and other researchers. The company's mission is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research in order to benefit humanity. OpenAI's goal is to develop AI that can be used for the benefit of all people.</p>
<p>OpenAI was founded with the belief that AI should be an extension of human intelligence rather than a replacement for it. The company has since become one of the most influential players in the field of AI research and development. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the history of OpenAI and how it all began.</p>

<h3>The Founding of OpenAI</h3>
<p>OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by a group of prominent tech entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba and others. The founding team had a shared vision for advancing artificial intelligence research in order to benefit humanity.</p>
<p>At the time of its founding, OpenAI was backed by some of the world’s leading technology companies including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and IBM Watson. This gave OpenAI access to powerful computing resources which allowed them to conduct their research more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>In addition to its corporate backers, OpenAI also received funding from individual investors such as Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman who believed in their mission and wanted to help them achieve their goals. This initial funding allowed OpenAI to hire top talent from around the world and begin their work on advancing AI research.</p>

<h3>OpenAI's Early Research Projects</h3>
<p>In its early days, OpenAI focused on developing algorithms that could be used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation or question answering systems. They also worked on developing reinforcement learning algorithms which could be used for robotics applications such as self-driving cars or robotic arms that can manipulate objects in an environment.</p>
<p>In 2016, OpenAI released Universe – an open source platform designed to enable developers to create virtual environments where they could train AI agents using reinforcement learning algorithms. This platform allowed developers to create virtual worlds where they could test out different AI agents without having access to physical hardware or expensive computing resources.</p>

<h3>OpenAI's Recent Achievements</h3>
<p>Since its founding in 2015, OpenAI has made significant progress towards achieving its mission of advancing artificial intelligence research for the benefit of humanity. In 2017 they released GPT-2 – a natural language processing model which achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks such as machine translation or question answering systems without any human intervention or supervision during training.</p>
<p>In 2018 they released Dactyl – an open source robotic hand designed for dexterous manipulation tasks such as opening doors or picking up objects from tables with high accuracy rates even when faced with unexpected situations or objects not seen during training time.</p>
<p>More recently in 2019 they released GPT-3 – an even more powerful natural language processing model which achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks without any human intervention during training time at all!</p>			
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>OpenAI has come a long way since it was founded back in December 2015 by Elon Musk and other prominent tech entrepreneurs and researchers with a shared vision for advancing artificial intelligence research for the benefit of humanity. Since then they have made significant progress towards achieving this goal through their various projects such as Universe, GPT-2 and GPT-3 which have achieved state-of-the art results on many NLP tasks without any human intervention during training time at all! We look forward to seeing what else this amazing team will achieve in the future!</p>
