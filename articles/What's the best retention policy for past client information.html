                        <p class="article-text">Retaining past client information is an important part of any business. It allows you to keep track of past customers and their interactions with your company, as well as providing a valuable source of data for future marketing and customer service initiatives. But with so many different types of data to store, it can be difficult to decide on the best retention policy for past client information.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">The first step in creating a retention policy is to determine what type of information you need to store. This will depend on the type of business you run and the services you provide. For example, if you are a retail store, you may need to store customer contact information, purchase history, and payment information. If you are a service provider, you may need to store customer contact information, service history, and payment information. Once you have identified the types of data you need to store, you can then decide on the best retention policy for that data.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8872512/pexels-photo-8872512.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="a-man-carrying-a-pile-of-documents"><figcaption>picture by MART  PRODUCTION</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">When it comes to customer contact information, it is important to keep this data up to date. This means that you should regularly review and update customer contact information, such as email addresses and phone numbers. This will ensure that you are able to reach out to customers when necessary and that you are able to provide them with the best possible customer service.</p><br><p class="article-text">When it comes to purchase history and payment information, it is important to keep this data for a certain period of time. This will allow you to track customer spending patterns and identify any potential issues or opportunities. It is also important to keep this data secure, as it contains sensitive information that could be used for identity theft or other malicious activities.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7788009/pexels-photo-7788009.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="gold-bitcoin-coin-on-background-of-growth-chart"><figcaption>picture by Ivan Babydov</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, when it comes to service history, it is important to keep this data for a certain period of time. This will allow you to track customer satisfaction levels and identify any potential issues or opportunities. It is also important to keep this data secure, as it contains sensitive information that could be used for identity theft or other malicious activities.</p><br>
