<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In today’s world, it’s no surprise that Amazon has become one of the most popular online retailers. With its vast selection of products and convenient delivery options, it’s easy to see why so many people choose to shop with Amazon. But one question that often comes up is whether or not Amazon can deliver items directly to your mailbox. The answer is yes, but there are a few things you should know before you make the decision to have your items delivered this way.</p>

<h3>What Is Mailbox Delivery?</h3>
<p>Mailbox delivery is a service offered by some online retailers, including Amazon, that allows customers to have their orders delivered directly to their mailbox instead of their home or office address. This service is especially useful for those who don’t have a secure place for packages to be left at their home or office, or for those who don’t want packages left on their doorstep where they could be stolen.</p>
<p>When you choose mailbox delivery from Amazon, your package will be sent via USPS and will arrive in your mailbox within 2-5 business days. You will receive an email notification when your package has been shipped and another when it has been delivered.</p>

<h3>What Items Can Be Delivered To Your Mailbox?</h3>
<p>Not all items can be delivered via mailbox delivery from Amazon. Generally speaking, only small items such as books, DVDs, CDs and other media can be sent this way. Larger items such as furniture and electronics cannot be sent via mailbox delivery due to size restrictions imposed by USPS. Additionally, some items may not qualify for mailbox delivery due to weight restrictions or other factors.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether an item qualifies for mailbox delivery from Amazon, simply check the product page before placing your order. If the item qualifies for mailbox delivery, it will be noted on the product page under “Shipping Options” with an estimated arrival date of 2-5 business days after shipment.</p>			
<h3>Are There Any Restrictions On Mailbox Delivery?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are a few restrictions on mailbox delivery from Amazon that you should be aware of before placing an order:</p>
<p>- You must have a valid street address in order for your package to be delivered via USPS; PO boxes are not eligible for this service</p>
<p>- You must provide a valid phone number in case USPS needs additional information about your address</p>
<p>- Your package must fit inside your mailbox; if it does not fit inside the box then USPS will leave a note with instructions on how to pick up the package at the post office</p>
<p>- Some items may not qualify for this service due to size or weight restrictions imposed by USPS; these items will need to be shipped via another method such as UPS or FedEx</p>
<p>- You may need to sign for certain packages upon delivery; if so then USPS will leave a note with instructions on how to pick up the package at the post office</p>
<p>- If you live in an apartment building then you may need someone else (such as a doorman) to accept the package on your behalf; if so then USPS will leave a note with instructions on how they can accept the package</p>
<p>- If you live in an area where mail theft is common then consider having your packages shipped via another method such as UPS or FedEx</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mailbox delivery from Amazon can be a convenient way of receiving small items such as books and DVDs without having them left at your doorstep where they could potentially get stolen. However, there are some restrictions that you should keep in mind before choosing this option such as size and weight limits imposed by USPS and potential issues with mail theft in certain areas. Ultimately it’s up to you whether or not this option is right for you but hopefully this article has given you enough information so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not using this service is right for you!</p>
