                        <p class="article-text">Safari Handoff is a feature that allows users to quickly and easily switch between their Apple devices, such as an iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It allows users to start a task on one device and then pick up where they left off on another device. Unfortunately, many users have reported that Safari Handoff is slow or doesn’t work at all.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">There are several potential reasons why Safari Handoff may be slow or not working. The first is that the feature requires both devices to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If the devices are not connected to the same Wi-Fi network, then Safari Handoff will not work. Additionally, if the Wi-Fi connection is weak or unreliable, then Safari Handoff may be slow or not work at all.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another potential reason why Safari Handoff may be slow or not working is that the feature requires both devices to be signed into the same iCloud account. If the devices are not signed into the same iCloud account, then Safari Handoff will not work. Additionally, if the iCloud account is not properly configured, then Safari Handoff may be slow or not work at all.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, Safari Handoff may be slow or not working if the feature is not enabled on both devices. To enable Safari Handoff, users must go to the Settings app on both devices and enable the “Allow Handoff” option. Additionally, users must also enable the “Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices” option in the General tab of the System Preferences app on their Mac.</p><br>
