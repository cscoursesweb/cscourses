                <meta name="description" content="Android Chrome does not currently support the ability to force a password suggestion, however, there are a few third-party apps that can help you generate secure passwords for your Android device. These apps can help you create strong passwords that are difficult to guess and can be used across multiple accounts. Additionally, some of these apps can also store your passwords securely, so you don't have to worry about forgetting them.">

                        <p class="article-text">Chrome desktop and Android Chrome are both web browsers developed by Google. While they share many features, there are some differences between the two. One of these differences is the ability to force a password suggestion.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">Chrome desktop does allow users to force a password suggestion. This feature is available in the settings menu, under the “Passwords” section. Here, users can enable the “Suggest passwords” option, which will prompt Chrome to suggest a password when creating a new account or changing an existing one.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2882630/pexels-photo-2882630.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="close-up-shot-of-keyboard-buttons"><figcaption>picture by Miguel Á. Padriñán</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">Unfortunately, Android Chrome does not support this feature. While the browser does offer a password manager, it does not have the ability to suggest passwords. This means that users must manually enter their passwords when creating or changing accounts.</p><br>
                        <p class="article-text">That said, Android Chrome does offer some features that are not available on Chrome desktop. For example, it has a built-in password generator, which can be used to create strong passwords. It also has a “Save passwords” option, which allows users to save their passwords for easy access.</p><br>
