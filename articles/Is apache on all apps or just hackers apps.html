                        <p class="article-text">The short answer to the question of whether Apache is on all apps or just hackers apps is that it depends. Apache is an open-source web server software that is used to host websites and web applications. It is one of the most popular web server software programs in the world, and it is used by millions of websites and web applications.</p><br>
                        
        <p class="article-text">However, Apache is not necessarily on all apps. It is most commonly used on web applications, but it can also be used on other types of applications. For example, Apache can be used to host a database, or it can be used to host a file server. It can also be used to host a variety of other types of applications, such as a content management system or a web-based email system.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/38544/imac-apple-mockup-app-38544.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="apple-office-internet-ipad"><figcaption>picture by Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">When it comes to hackers, Apache is often used to host malicious applications. Hackers can use Apache to host malicious applications that can be used to gain access to a system or to steal data. Apache can also be used to host malicious websites that can be used to spread malware or to launch attacks against other systems.</p><br>
