<h3>What Shipping Options Are Available for Canadian Customers?</h3>

<h3>Are There Any Additional Fees or Taxes I Should Be Aware Of?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are additional fees and taxes that may apply when shipping items from Amazon US to Canada. These include customs duties (which vary depending on the item being shipped), GST/HST (Goods & Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax), PST (Provincial Sales Tax), brokerage fees (which vary depending on the carrier used) and fuel surcharges (which also vary depending on the carrier used). It’s important to note that these fees are not included in the cost of shipping and must be paid separately upon delivery of your package(s). Additionally, some carriers may require a signature upon delivery in order for them to release your package(s).</p>			
<h3>What Are Some Tips For Saving Money On Shipping To Canada?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there are several ways you can save money when shipping items from Amazon US to Canada. One way is by taking advantage of free shipping offers when they become available – many times these offers will include free shipping on orders over a certain amount or free two-day shipping on select items. Additionally, if you’re ordering multiple items at once it may be more cost effective to have them all shipped together rather than individually – this will help reduce overall shipping costs as well as minimize any additional fees or taxes that may apply. Finally, if possible try ordering items that don’t require special handling or packaging – this will help keep costs down as well since these types of items often incur additional charges due their size or weight restrictions.</p>
