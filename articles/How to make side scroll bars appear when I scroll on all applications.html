        <p class="article-text">If you’ve ever been frustrated by the lack of side scroll bars when you’re scrolling through an application, you’re not alone. Many applications, such as the New York Times and Globe and Mail apps, don’t have side scroll bars, making it difficult to navigate the page. Fortunately, there are a few ways to make side scroll bars appear when you scroll on all applications.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5553645/pexels-photo-5553645.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="serious-ethnic-student-using-tablet-on-bench"><figcaption>picture by Armin  Rimoldi</figcaption></figure><p class="article-text">The first way to make side scroll bars appear is to adjust your browser settings. Most browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, have an option to enable scroll bars. To do this, open your browser and go to the settings menu. From there, look for the “Display” or “Appearance” section and select the “Show scroll bars” option. This should make the scroll bars appear on all applications.</p><br><p class="article-text">Another way to make side scroll bars appear is to adjust the zoom level of the page. Many applications, such as the New York Times and Globe and Mail apps, have a zoom feature that can be adjusted to make the page larger or smaller. If the page is too small, the scroll bars may not appear. To adjust the zoom level, open the application and look for the “Zoom” option. From there, you can adjust the zoom level to make the page larger or smaller.</p><br><figure><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/10604641/pexels-photo-10604641.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" class="article-image" alt="hands-correcting-womans-necklace"><figcaption>picture by Duané Viljoen</figcaption></figure>
                        <p class="article-text">Finally, you can also make side scroll bars appear by adjusting the size of the window. If the window is too small, the scroll bars may not appear. To adjust the size of the window, open the application and look for the “Window” option. From there, you can adjust the size of the window to make it larger or smaller.</p><br>
